This set of 209 placeables provides a variety of third party
models that have been ported for use in Neverwinter Nights 2, along
with some of my own contributions that I've previously used for
various purposes. It is an expansion to content for the City-State
Project, and the blueprints have been numbered accordingly. Some of
the models have been animated.

A big thank you goes to the model builders whose excellent works
have been included in this set. (See the credits below.) I hope you
find a use for some of these works in your own modules.
