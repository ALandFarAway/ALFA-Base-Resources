This builders resource is a complete interior tileset modeled after the adobe houses
found in a desert setting. It is intended to complement Barons Adobe Pack, and is
primarily useful for building small structures with just a few rooms.

The tileset walls are smooth surfaces with beveled corners and a wooden ceiling
supported by round wooden beams. The floor is lowered below the normal level, with
steps at the door opening. There are no stairways; instead, movement between level
is accomplished using ladders that pass through holes in the floor or ceiling.
Tileset variants provide some windowed surfaces, niches, and some compatible
placeables.

Enjoy!
