/*
    The Mindflayer's Extract Brain ability

    Since we can not simulate the When All 4 tentacles
    hit condition reliably, we use this approach for
    extract brain

    It is only triggered through the specialized
    mindflayer AI if the player is helpless.
    (see x2_ai_mflayer for details)

    If the player is helpless, the mindflayer will
    walk up and cast this spell, which has the Suck Brain
    special creature animation tied to it through spells.2da

    The spell first performs a melee touch attack. If that succeeds
    in <Hardcore difficulty, the player is awarded a Fortitude Save
    against DC 10+(HD/2).

    If the save fails, or the player is on a hardcore+ difficulty
    setting, the mindflayer will do d3()+2 points of permanent
    intelligence damage. Once a character's intelligence drops
    below 5, his enough of her brain has been extracted to kill her.

    As a little special condition, if the player is either diseased
    or poisoned, the mindflayer will also become disases or poisoned
    if by sucking the brain.
