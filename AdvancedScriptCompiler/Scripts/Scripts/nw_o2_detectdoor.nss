/*
    This Invisable object will do a check and see
    if any pc comes within a radius of this object.

    If the PC has the search skill or is a elf then
    a search check will be made.

    It will create a trap door that will have its
    Destination set to a waypoint that has
    a tag of DST_<tag of this object>

    The radius is determined by the reflex saving
    throw of the invisible object

    The DC of the search stored by the willpower
    saving throw.

//:: fixed problem with the aborting of the search
//:: for PC that where in the search radius.
//:: it was aborting when it got found a PC that
//:: outside the search distance, but this also
//:: canceled the search check.
//::
//:: This will teach me to trust code mailed in
