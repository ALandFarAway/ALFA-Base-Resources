/*

Spell script for Deck of Many Things object.

NOTES:
- user must decide to draw 1, 2, 3 cards at the outset (done via
  radial menu), and once this decision is made, the cards will all
  be drawn one after another, inexorably.
- user can only get more than 3 cards via the Joker or the Fool
- user can only use the deck once per character per module

See the library x0_i0_deckmany for how the individual cards
are implemented, and for ways to add your own cards.
