The ice temple tileset is a complete set of all new tiles for the Neverwinter Nights 2
toolset engine and game. It includes 161 unique tile variants, plus nine metatiles,
and four texture variants: ice, marble, wood, and dungeon. The tiles were modelled
after the Ice Temple in the Icewind Dale 2 game.

I hope you enjoy this set and find a use for them in your own modules.

Installation

To load the tiles into your toolset, install the files into the Neverwinter Nights 2
directory found under your My Documents folder as follows:

+ Copy the ice_temple_tileset.hak file into the hak folder
+ Copy the 2da files into the override folder
+ The Tiles section of your Toolset should now have an 'Ice Temple' entry
