<0><16777216>:Appraise
<1><16777217>:Appraise (Int)

Check:
You can appraise common or well-known objects with a DC 12 Appraise check. Failure means that you estimate the value at 50% to 150% (2d6+3 times 10%,) of its actual value.

Appraising a rare or exotic item requires a successful check against DC 15, 20, or higher. If the check is successful, you estimate the value correctly; failure means you cannot estimate the item's value.

A magnifying glass gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Appraise checks involving any item that is small or highly detailed, such as a gem. A merchant's scale gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Appraise checks involving any items that are valued by weight, including anything made of precious metals.

These bonuses stack.

Action:
Appraising an item takes 1 minute (ten consecutive full-round actions).

Try Again:
No. You cannot try again on the same object, regardless of success.

Special:
A dwarf gets a +2 racial bonus on Appraise checks that are related to stone or metal items because dwarves are familiar with valuable items of all kinds (especially those made of stone or metal).

The master of a raven familiar gains a +3 bonus on Appraise checks.

A character with the Diligent feat gets a +2 bonus on Appraise checks.

Synergy:
If you have 5 ranks in any Craft skill, you gain a +2 bonus on Appraise checks related to items made with that Craft skill.

Untrained:
For common items, failure on an untrained check means no estimate. For rare items, success means an estimate of 50% to 150% (2d6+3 times 10%).

<3><16777219>:<b><i>NOTE: This skill is primarily usable with DM assistance, and as such, may be less frequently useable than hardcoded skills directly referenced by the game engine.</b></i>

Balance (Dex; Armor Check Penalty)

Check:
You can walk on a precarious surface. A successful check lets you move at half your speed along the surface for 1 round. A failure by 4 or less means you can't move for 1 round. A failure by 5 or more means you fall. The difficulty varies with the surface, as follows:

Narrow Surface       Balance DC    
 7-12 inches wide         10          
 2-6  inches wide         15          
 Less than 2 inches wide  20          

Difficult Surface       Balance DC
 Uneven flagstone           10*
 Hewn stone floor           10*
 Sloped or angled floor     10*

     1. Add modifiers from Narrow Surface Modifiers, below, as appropriate.
     *  Only if running or charging. Failure by 4 or less means that the character can't run or charge but may           otherwise act normally.

Narrow Surface Modifiers:
Surface                    DC Modifier*
Lightly obstructed             +2
Severely obstructed            +5
Lightly slippery               +2
Severely slippery              +5
Sloped or angled               +2

*These modifiers stack.

Being Attacked while Balancing:
You are considered flat-footed while balancing, since you can't move to avoid a blow, and thus you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC (if any). If you have 5 or more ranks in Balance, you aren't considered flat-footed while balancing. If you take damage while balancing, you must make another Balance check against the same DC to remain standing.

Accelerated Movement:
You can try to walk across a precarious surface more quickly than normal. If you accept a -5 penalty, you can move your full speed as a move action. (Moving twice your speed in a round requires two Balance checks, one for each move action used.) You may also accept this penalty in order to charge across a precarious surface; charging requires one Balance check for each multiple of your speed (or fraction thereof) that you charge.

Action:
None. A Balance check doesn't require an action; it is made as part of another action or as a reaction to a situation.

Special:
If you have the Agile feat, you get a +2 bonus on Balance checks.

Synergy:
If you have 5 or more ranks in Tumble, you get a +2 bonus on Balance checks.
<4><16777220>:Bluff
<5><16777221>:Bluff (Cha)

Check:
A Bluff check is opposed by the target's Sense Motive check. See the accompanying table for examples of different kinds of bluffs and the modifier to the target's Sense Motive check for each one.

Favorable and unfavorable circumstances weigh heavily on the outcome of a bluff. Two circumstances can weigh against you: The bluff is hard to believe, or the action that the target is asked to take goes against its self-interest, nature, personality, orders, or the like. If it's important, you can distinguish between a bluff that fails because the target doesn't believe it and one that fails because it just asks too much of the target. For instance, if the target gets a +10 bonus on its Sense Motive check because the bluff demands something risky, and the Sense Motive check succeeds by 10 or less, then the target didn't so much see through the bluff as prove reluctant to go along with it. A target that succeeds by 11 or more has seen through the bluff.

A successful Bluff check indicates that the target reacts as you wish, at least for a short time (usually 1 round or less) or believes something that you want it to believe. Bluff, however, is not a suggestion spell.

A bluff requires interaction between you and the target. Creatures unaware of you cannot be bluffed.

Feinting in Combat:
You can also use Bluff to mislead an opponent in melee combat (so that it can't dodge your next attack effectively). To feint, make a Bluff check opposed by your target's Sense Motive check, but in this case, the target may add its base attack bonus to the roll along with any other applicable modifiers.

If your Bluff check result exceeds this special Sense Motive check result, your target is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) for the next melee attack you make against it. This attack must be made on or before your next turn.

Feinting in this way against a nonhumanoid is difficult because it's harder to read a strange creature's body language; you take a -4 penalty on your Bluff check. Against a creature of animal Intelligence (1 or 2) it's even harder; you take a -8 penalty. Against a nonintelligent creature, it's impossible.

Feinting in combat does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

Creating a Diversion to Hide:
You can use the Bluff skill to help you hide. A successful Bluff check gives you the momentary diversion you need to attempt a Hide check while people are aware of you. This usage does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

Delivering a Secret Message:
You can use Bluff to get a message across to another character without others understanding it. The DC is 15 for simple messages, or 20 for complex messages, especially those that rely on getting across new information. Failure by 4 or less means you can't get the message across. Failure by 5 or more means that some false information has been implied or inferred. Anyone listening to the exchange can make a Sense Motive check opposed by the Bluff check you made to transmit in order to intercept your message (see Sense Motive).
See also: esc usages of Bluff.

Action:
Varies. A Bluff check made as part of general interaction always takes at least 1 round (and is at least a full-round action), but it can take much longer if you try something elaborate. A Bluff check made to feint in combat or create a diversion to hide is a standard action. A Bluff check made to deliver a secret message doesn't take an action; it is part of normal communication.

Try Again:
Varies. Generally, a failed Bluff check in social interaction makes the target too suspicious for you to try again in the same circumstances, but you may retry freely on Bluff checks made to feint in combat. Retries are also allowed when you are trying to send a message, but you may attempt such a retry only once per round.

Each retry carries the same chance of miscommunication.

Special:
A ranger gains a bonus on Bluff checks when using this skill against a favored enemy.

The master of a snake familiar gains a +3 bonus on Bluff checks.

If you have the Persuasive feat, you get a +2 bonus on Bluff checks.

Synergy:
If you have 5 or more ranks in Bluff, you get a +2 bonus on Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sleight of Hand checks, as well as on Disguise checks made when you know you're being observed and you try to act in character.

Sense Motive Modifiers:
The target wants to believe you:
-5

The bluff is believable and doesn't affect the target much:
+0

The bluff is a little hard to believe or puts the target at some risk:
+5

The bluff is hard to believe or puts the target at significant risk:
+10

The bluff is way out there, almost too incredible to consider:
+20
<6><16777222>:Climb
<7><16777223>:<b><i>NOTE: This skill is primarily usable with DM assistance, and as such, may be less frequently useable than hardcoded skills directly referenced by the game engine.</b></i>

Climb (Str; Armor Check Penalty)

Check:
With a successful Climb check, you can advance up, down, or across a slope, a wall, or some other steep incline (or even a ceiling with handholds) at one-quarter your normal speed. A slope is considered to be any incline at an angle measuring less than 60 degrees; a wall is any incline at an angle measuring 60 degrees or more.

A Climb check that fails by 4 or less means that you make no progress, and one that fails by 5 or more means that you fall from whatever height you have already attained.

A climber's kit gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Climb checks.

The DC of the check depends on the conditions of the climb. Compare the task with those on the following table to determine an appropriate DC.

Climb DCs:
 0 A slope too steep to walk up, or a knotted rope with a wall to brace against.
 5 A rope with a wall to brace against, or a knotted rope, or a rope affected by the rope trick spell.
 10 A surface with ledges to hold on to and stand on, such as a very rough wall or a ship's rigging.
 15 Any surface with adequate handholds and footholds (natural or artificial), such as a very rough natural rock surface or a tree, or an unknotted rope, or pulling yourself up when dangling by your hands.
 20 An uneven surface with some narrow handholds and footholds, such as a typical wall in a dungeon or ruins.
 25 A rough surface, such as a natural rock wall or a brick wall.
 25 An overhang or ceiling with handholds but no footholds.
— A perfectly smooth, flat, vertical surface cannot be climbed.

Climb DC Modifiers:
(These modifiers are cumulative; use any that apply)
 -10 Climbing a chimney (artificial or natural) or other location where you can brace against two opposite walls (reduces DC by 10).
 -5 Climbing a corner where you can brace against perpendicular walls (reduces DC by 5).
 +5 Surface is slippery (increases DC by 5).

You need both hands free to climb, but you may cling to a wall with one hand while you cast a spell or take some other action that requires only one hand. While climbing, you can't move to avoid a blow, so you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC (if any). You also can't use a shield while climbing.

Any time you take damage while climbing, make a Climb check against the DC of the slope or wall. Failure means you fall from your current height and sustain the appropriate falling damage.

Accelerated Climbing:
You try to climb more quickly than normal. By accepting a -5 penalty, you can move half your speed (instead of one-quarter your speed).

Making Your Own Handholds and Footholds:
You can make your own handholds and footholds by pounding pitons into a wall. Doing so takes 1 minute per piton, and one piton is needed per 3 feet of distance. As with any surface that offers handholds and footholds, a wall with pitons in it has a DC of 15. In the same way, a climber with a handaxe or similar implement can cut handholds in an ice wall.

Catching Yourself When Falling:
It's practically impossible to catch yourself on a wall while falling. Make a Climb check (DC = wall's DC + 20) to do so. It's much easier to catch yourself on a slope (DC = slope's DC + 10).

Catching a Falling Character While Climbing:
If someone climbing above you or adjacent to you falls, you can attempt to catch the falling character if he or she is within your reach. Doing so requires a successful melee touch attack against the falling character (though he or she can voluntarily forego any Dexterity bonus to AC if desired). If you hit, you must immediately attempt a Climb check (DC = wall's DC + 10). Success indicates that you catch the falling character, but his or her total weight, including equipment, cannot exceed your heavy load limit or you automatically fall. If you fail your Climb check by 4 or less, you fail to stop the character's fall but don't lose your grip on the wall. If you fail by 5 or more, you fail to stop the character's fall and begin falling as well.

Action:
Climbing is part of movement, so it's generally part of a move action (and may be combined with other types of movement in a move action). Each move action that includes any climbing requires a separate Climb check. Catching yourself or another falling character doesn't take an action.

Special:
You can use a rope to haul a character upward (or lower a character) through sheer strength. You can lift double your maximum load in this manner.

A halfling has a +2 racial bonus on Climb checks because halflings are agile and surefooted.

The master of a lizard familiar gains a +3 bonus on Climb checks.

If you have the Athletic feat, you get a +2 bonus on Climb checks.

A creature with a climb speed has a +8 racial bonus on all Climb checks. The creature must make a Climb check to climb any wall or slope with a DC higher than 0, but it always can choose to take 10, even if rushed or threatened while climbing. If a creature with a climb speed chooses an accelerated climb (see above), it moves at double its climb speed (or at its land speed, whichever is slower) and makes a single Climb check at a -5 penalty. Such a creature retains its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus to their attacks against it. It cannot, however, use the run action while climbing.

Synergy:
If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Rope, you get a +2 bonus on Climb checks made to climb a rope, a knotted rope, or a rope-and-wall combination. 
<8><16777224>:Concentration
<9><16777225>:Concentration (Con)

Check:
You must make a Concentration check whenever you might potentially be distracted (by taking damage, by harsh weather, and so on) while engaged in some action that requires your full attention. Such actions include casting a spell, concentrating on an active spell, directing a spell, using a spell-like ability, or using a skill that would provoke an attack of opportunity. In general, if an action wouldn't normally provoke an attack of opportunity, you need not make a Concentration check to avoid being distracted.

If the Concentration check succeeds, you may continue with the action as normal. If the check fails, the action automatically fails and is wasted. If you were in the process of casting a spell, the spell is lost. If you were concentrating on an active spell, the spell ends as if you had ceased concentrating on it. If you were directing a spell, the direction fails but the spell remains active. If you were using a spell-like ability, that use of the ability is lost. A skill use also fails, and in some cases a failed skill check may have other ramifications as well.

The table below summarizes various types of distractions that cause you to make a Concentration check. If the distraction occurs while you are trying to cast a spell, you must add the level of the spell you are trying to cast to the appropriate Concentration DC. If more than one type of distraction is present, make a check for each one; any failed Concentration check indicates that the task is not completed.

Concentration DCs(1) and distractions:
10 + damage dealt: Damaged during the action.(2)
10 + half of continuous damage last dealt: Taking continuous damage during the action.(3)
Distracting spell's save DC: Distracted by nondamaging spell.(4)
10: Vigorous motion (on a moving mount, taking a bouncy wagon ride, in a small boat in rough water, belowdecks in a stormtossed ship).
15: Violent motion (on a galloping horse, taking a very rough wagon ride, in a small boat in rapids, on the deck of a storm-tossed ship).
20: Extraordinarily violent motion (earthquake).
15: Entangled.
20: Grappling or pinned. (You can cast only spells without somatic components for which you have any required material component in hand.)
5: Weather is a high wind carrying blinding rain or sleet.
10: Weather is wind-driven hail, dust, or debris.
Distracting spell's save DC: Weather caused by a spell, such as storm of vengeance.(4)

(1) If you are trying to cast, concentrate on, or direct a spell when the distraction occurs, add the level of the spell to the indicated DC.
(2) Such as during the casting of a spell with a casting time of 1 round or more, or the execution of an activity that takes more than a single full-round action (such as Disable Device). Also, damage stemming from an attack of opportunity or readied attack made in response to the spell being cast (for spells with a casting time of 1 standard action) or the action being taken (for activities requiring no more than a full-round action).
(3) Such as from acid arrow.
(4) If the spell allows no save, use the save DC it would have if it did allow a save.

Action:
None. Making a Concentration check doesn't take an action; it is either a free action (when attempted reactively) or part of another action (when attempted actively).

Try Again:
Yes, though a success doesn't cancel the effect of a previous failure, such as the loss of a spell you were casting or the disruption of a spell you were concentrating on.

Special:
You can use Concentration to cast a spell, use a spell-like ability, or use a skill defensively, so as to avoid attacks of opportunity altogether. This doesn't apply to other actions that might provoke attacks of opportunity.

The DC of the check is 15 (plus the spell's level, if casting a spell or using a spell-like ability defensively). If the Concentration check succeeds, you may attempt the action normally without provoking any attacks of opportunity. A successful Concentration check still doesn't allow you to take 10 on another check if you are in a stressful situation; you must make the check normally. If the Concentration check fails, the related action also automatically fails (with any appropriate ramifications), and the action is wasted, just as if your concentration had been disrupted by a distraction.

A character with the Combat Casting feat gets a +4 bonus on Concentration checks made to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability while on the defensive or while grappling or pinned.

Craft (Int)

Like Knowledge, Perform, and Profession, Craft is actually a number of separate skills. You could have several Craft skills, each with its own ranks, each purchased as a separate skill.

A Craft skill is specifically focused on creating something. If nothing is created by the endeavor, it probably falls under the heading of a Profession skill.

Check:
You can practice your trade and make a decent living, earning about half your check result in gold pieces per week of dedicated work. You know how to use the tools of your trade, how to perform the craft's daily tasks, how to supervise untrained helpers, and how to handle common problems. (Untrained laborers and assistants earn an average of 1 silver piece per day.)

The basic function of the Craft skill, however, is to allow you to make an item of the appropriate type. The DC depends on the complexity of the item to be created. The DC, your check results, and the price of the item determine how long it takes to make a particular item. The item's finished price also determines the cost of raw materials.

In some cases, the fabricate spell can be used to achieve the results of a Craft check with no actual check involved. However, you must make an appropriate Craft check when using the spell to make articles requiring a high degree of craftsmanship.

A successful Craft check related to woodworking in conjunction with the casting of the ironwood spell enables you to make wooden items that have the strength of steel.

When casting the spell minor creation, you must succeed on an appropriate Craft check to make a complex item.

All crafts require artisan's tools to give the best chance of success. If improvised tools are used, the check is made with a -2 circumstance penalty. On the other hand, masterwork artisan's tools provide a +2 circumstance bonus on the check.

To determine how much time and money it takes to make an item, follow these steps:
   1. Find the item's price. Put the price in silver pieces (1 gp = 10 sp).
   2. Find the DC from the table below.
   3. Pay one-third of the item's price for the cost of raw materials.
   4. Make an appropriate Craft check representing one week's work. If the check succeeds, multiply your check result by the DC. If the result × the DC equals the price of the item in sp, then you have completed the item. (If the result × the DC equals double or triple the price of the item in silver pieces, then you've completed the task in one-half or one-third of the time. Other multiples of the DC reduce the time in the same manner.) If the result × the DC doesn't equal the price, then it represents the progress you've made this week. Record the result and make a new Craft check for the next week. Each week, you make more progress until your total reaches the price of the item in silver pieces.

If you fail a check by 4 or less, you make no progress this week.

If you fail by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the original raw material cost again.

Progress by the Day:
You can make checks by the day instead of by the week. In this case your progress (check result × DC) is in copper pieces instead of silver pieces.

Creating Masterwork Items:
You can make a masterwork item—a weapon, suit of armor, shield, or tool that conveys a bonus on its use through its exceptional craftsmanship, not through being magical. To create a masterwork item, you create the masterwork component as if it were a separate item in addition to the standard item. The masterwork component has its own price (300 gp for a weapon or 150 gp for a suit of armor or a shield) and a Craft DC of 20. Once both the standard component and the masterwork component are completed, the masterwork item is finished. Note: The cost you pay for the masterwork component is one-third of the given amount, just as it is for the cost in raw materials.

Repairing Items:
Generally, you can repair an item by making checks against the same DC that it took to make the item in the first place. The cost of repairing an item is one-fifth of the item's price.

When you use the Craft skill to make a particular sort of item, the DC for checks involving the creation of that item are typically as given on the following table.

Crafting skill DCs:
--------------------------------------------------
Acid: Alchemy(1), 15
Alchemist's fire, smokestick, or tindertwig: Alchemy(1), 20
Antitoxin, sunrod, tanglefoot bag, or thunderstone: Alchemy(1), 25
Armor or shield: Armorsmithing, 10 + AC bonus
Longbow or shortbow: Bowmaking, 12
Composite longbow or composite shortbow: Bowmaking, 15
Composite longbow or composite shortbow with high strength rating: Bowmaking, 15 + (2 × rating)
Crossbow: Weaponsmithing, 15
Simple melee or thrown weapon: Weaponsmithing, 12
Martial melee or thrown weapon: Weaponsmithing, 15
Exotic melee or thrown weapon: Weaponsmithing, 18
Mechanical trap: Trapmaking, Varies(2)
Very simple item (wooden spoon): Varies, 5
Typical item (iron pot): Varies, 10
High-quality item (bell): Varies, 15
Complex or superior item (lock): Varies, 20
--------------------------------------------------
(1) You must be a spellcaster to craft any of these items.
(2) Traps have their own rules for construction.

Action:
Does not apply. Craft checks are made by the day or week (see above).

Try Again:
Yes, but each time you miss by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the original raw material cost again.

Special:
A dwarf has a +2 racial bonus on Craft checks that are related to stone or metal, because dwarves are especially capable with stonework and metalwork.

A gnome has a +2 racial bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks because gnomes have sensitive noses.

You may voluntarily add +10 to the indicated DC to craft an item. This allows you to create the item more quickly (since you'll be multiplying this higher DC by your Craft check result to determine progress). You must decide whether to increase the DC before you make each weekly or daily check.

To make an item using Craft (alchemy), you must have alchemical equipment and be a spellcaster. If you are working in a city, you can buy what you need as part of the raw materials cost to make the item, but alchemical equipment is difficult or impossible to come by in some places. Purchasing and maintaining an alchemist's lab grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks because you have the perfect tools for the job, but it does not affect the cost of any items made using the skill.

Synergy:
If you have 5 ranks in a Craft skill, you get a +2 bonus on Appraise checks related to items made with that Craft skill. 
<16><16777232>:Decipher Script
<17><16777233>:<b><i>NOTE: This skill is primarily usable with DM assistance, and as such, may be less frequently useable than hardcoded skills directly referenced by the game engine.</b></i>

Decipher Script (Int; Trained Only)

Check:
You can decipher writing in an unfamiliar language or a message written in an incomplete or archaic form. The base DC is 20 for the simplest messages, 25 for standard texts, and 30 or higher for intricate, exotic, or very old writing.

If the check succeeds, you understand the general content of a piece of writing about one page long (or the equivalent). If the check fails, make a DC 5 Wisdom check to see if you avoid drawing a false conclusion about the text. (Success means that you do not draw a false conclusion; failure means that you do.)

Both the Decipher Script check and (if necessary) the Wisdom check are made secretly, so that you can't tell whether the conclusion you draw is true or false.

See also: epic usages of Decipher Script.

Action:
Deciphering the equivalent of a single page of script takes 1 minute (ten consecutive full-round actions).

Try Again:
No.

Special:
A character with the Diligent feat gets a +2 bonus on Decipher Script checks.

Synergy:
If you have 5 or more ranks in Decipher Script, you get a +2 bonus on Use Magic Device checks involving scrolls. 
<18><16777234>:Diplomacy
<19><16777235>:Diplomacy (Cha)

Check:
You can change the attitudes of others (nonplayer characters) with a successful Diplomacy check; see the Influencing NPC Attitudes sidebar, below, for basic DCs. In negotiations, participants roll opposed Diplomacy checks, and the winner gains the advantage. Opposed checks also resolve situations when two advocates or diplomats plead opposite cases in a hearing before a third party.

Action:
Changing others' attitudes with Diplomacy generally takes at least 1 full minute (10 consecutive full-round actions). In some situations, this time requirement may greatly increase. A rushed Diplomacy check can be made as a full-round action, but you take a -10 penalty on the check.

Try Again:
Optional, but not recommended because retries usually do not work. Even if the initial Diplomacy check succeeds, the other character can be persuaded only so far, and a retry may do more harm than good. If the initial check fails, the other character has probably become more firmly committed to his position, and a retry is futile.

Special:
A half-elf has a +2 racial bonus on Diplomacy checks.

If you have the Negotiator feat, you get a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks.

Synergy:
If you have 5 or more ranks in Bluff, Knowledge (nobility and royalty), or Sense Motive, you get a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks.

Use the table below to determine the effectiveness of Diplomacy checks (or Charisma checks) made to influence the attitude of a nonplayer character, or wild empathy checks made to influence the attitude of an animal or magical beast.

Influencing NPC Attitudes:
Initial Attitude          Hostile      Unfriendly     Indifferent     Friendly     Helpful
Hostile                Less than 20        20              25             35          50

<20><16777236>:Disable Device
<21><16777237>:Disable Device(Int;Trained Only)

Check:
The Disable Device check is made secretly, so that you don't necessarily know whether you've succeeded. 
The DC depends on how tricky the device is. Disabling (or rigging or jamming) a fairly simple device has a DC of 10; more intricate and complex devices have higher DCs.

If the check succeeds, you disable the device. If it fails by 4 or less, you have failed but can try again. If you fail by 5 or more, something goes wrong. If the device is a trap, you spring it. If you're attempting some sort of sabotage, you think the device is disabled, but it still works normally.

You also can rig simple devices such as saddles or wagon wheels to work normally for a while and then fail or fall off some time later (usually after 1d4 rounds or minutes of use).
Device Time     Disable
Device DC1      Example

1. If you attempt to leave behind no trace of your tampering, add 5 to the DC.

See also: epic usages of Disable Device.

Action:
The amount of time needed to make a Disable Device check depends on the task, as noted above. Disabling a simple device takes 1 round and is a full-round action. An intricate or complex device requires 1d4 or 2d4 rounds.

Try Again:
Varies. You can retry if you have missed the check by 4 or less, though you must be aware that you have failed in order to try again.

Special:
If you have the Nimble Fingers feat, you get a +2 bonus on Disable Device checks.

A rogue who beats a trap's DC by 10 or more can study the trap, figure out how it works, and bypass it (along with her companions) without disarming it.

Restriction:
Rogues (and other characters with the trapfinding class feature) can disarm magic traps. A magic trap generally has a DC of 25 + the spell level of the magic used to create it.

The spells fire trap, glyph of warding, symbol, and teleportation circle also create traps that a rogue can disarm with a successful Disable Device check. Spike growth and spike stones, however, create magic traps against which Disable Device checks do not succeed. See the individual spell descriptions for details.

Disguise (Cha)

Check:
Your Disguise check result determines how good the disguise is, and it is opposed by others' Spot check results. If you don't draw any attention to yourself, others do not get to make Spot checks. If you come to the attention of people who are suspicious (such as a guard who is watching commoners walking through a city gate), it can be assumed that such observers are taking 10 on their Spot checks.

You get only one Disguise check per use of the skill, even if several people are making Spot checks against it. The Disguise check is made secretly, so that you can't be sure how good the result is.

The effectiveness of your disguise depends in part on how much you're attempting to change your appearance. 
If you are impersonating a particular individual, those who know what that person looks like get a bonus on their Spot checks according to the table below. Furthermore, they are automatically considered to be suspicious of you, so opposed checks are always called for.

Usually, an individual makes a Spot check to see through your disguise immediately upon meeting you and each hour thereafter. If you casually meet many different creatures, each for a short time, check once per day or hour, using an average Spot modifier for the group.

See also: epic usages of Disguise.

Action:
Creating a disguise requires 1d3×10 minutes of work.

Try Again:
Yes. You may try to redo a failed disguise, but once others know that a disguise was attempted, they'll be more suspicious.

Special:
Magic that alters your form, such as alter self, disguise self, polymorph, or shapechange, grants you a +10 bonus on Disguise checks (see the individual spell descriptions). You must succeed on a Disguise check with a +10 bonus to duplicate the appearance of a specific individual using the veil spell. Divination magic that allows people to see through illusions (such as true seeing) does not penetrate a mundane disguise, but it can negate the magical component of a magically enhanced one.

You must make a Disguise check when you cast a simulacrum spell to determine how good the likeness is.

If you have the Deceitful feat, you get a +2 bonus on Disguise checks.

Synergy:
If you have 5 or more ranks in Bluff, you get a +2 bonus on Disguise checks when you know that you're being observed and you try to act in character.

Escape Artist (Dex; Armor Check Penalty)

Check:
The table below gives the DCs to escape various forms of restraints.

Ropes:
Your Escape Artist check is opposed by the binder's Use Rope check. Since it's easier to tie someone up than to escape from being tied up, the binder gets a +10 bonus on his or her check.

Manacles and Masterwork Manacles:
The DC for manacles is set by their construction.

Tight Space:
The DC noted on the table is for getting through a space where your head fits but your shoulders don't. If the space is long you may need to make multiple checks. You can't get through a space that your head does not fit through.

Grappler:
You can make an Escape Artist check opposed by your enemy's grapple check to get out of a grapple or out of a pinned condition (so that you're only grappling).
See also: epic usages of Escape Artist.

Action:
Making an Escape Artist check to escape from rope bindings, manacles, or other restraints (except a grappler) requires 1 minute of work. Escaping from a net or an animate rope, command plants, control plants, or entangle spell is a full-round action. Escaping from a grapple or pin is a standard action. Squeezing through a tight space takes at least 1 minute, maybe longer, depending on how long the space is.

Try Again:
Varies. You can make another check after a failed check if you're squeezing your way through a tight space, making multiple checks. If the situation permits, you can make additional checks, or even take 20, as long as you're not being actively opposed.

Special:
If you have the Agile feat, you get a +2 bonus on Escape Artist checks.

Synergy:
* If you have 5 or more ranks in Escape Artist, you get a +2 bonus on Use Rope checks to bind someone.
* If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Rope, you get a +2 bonus on Escape Artist checks when escaping from rope bonds.

Forgery (Int)

Check:
Forgery requires writing materials appropriate to the document being forged, enough light or sufficient visual acuity to see the details of what you're writing, wax for seals (if appropriate), and some time. To forge a document on which the handwriting is not specific to a person (military orders, a government decree, a business ledger, or the like), you need only to have seen a similar document before, and you gain a +8 bonus on your check. To forge a signature, you need an autograph of that person to copy, and you gain a +4 bonus on the check. To forge a longer document written in the hand of some particular person, a large sample of that person's handwriting is needed.

The Forgery check is made secretly, so that you're not sure how good your forgery is. As with Disguise, you don't even need to make a check until someone examines the work. Your Forgery check is opposed by the Forgery check of the person who examines the document to check its authenticity. The examiner gains modifiers on his or her check if any of the conditions on the table below exist.

Condition                                          Reader's Forgery Check Modifier
Type of document unknown to reader                               -2
Type of document somewhat unknown to reader                      +0
Type of document well known to reader                            +2
Handwriting not known to reader                                  -2
Handwriting somewhat known to reader                             +0
Handwriting intimately known to reader                           +2
Reader only casually reviews the document                        -2 

A document that contradicts procedure, orders, or previous knowledge, or one that requires sacrifice on the part of the person checking the document can increase that character's suspicion (and thus create favorable circumstances for the checker's opposing Forgery check).
See also: epic usages of Forgery.

Action:
Forging a very short and simple document takes about 1 minute. A longer or more complex document takes 1d4 minutes per page.

Try Again:
Usually, no. A retry is never possible after a particular reader detects a particular forgery. But the document created by the forger might still fool someone else. The result of a Forgery check for a particular document must be used for every instance of a different reader examining the document. No reader can attempt to detect a particular forgery more than once; if that one opposed check goes in favor of the forger, then the reader can't try using his own skill again, even if he's suspicious about the document.

Special:
If you have the Deceitful feat, you get a +2 bonus on Forgery checks.

Restriction:
Forgery is language-dependent; thus, to forge documents and detect forgeries, you must be able to read and write the language in question. A barbarian can't learn the Forgery skill unless he has learned to read and write.

<29><16777245>:<b><i>NOTE: This skill is primarily usable with DM assistance, and as such, may be less frequently useable than hardcoded skills directly referenced by the game engine.</b></i>

Gather Information (Cha)

Check:
An evening's time, a few gold pieces for buying drinks and making friends, and a DC 10 Gather Information check get you a general idea of a city's major news items, assuming there are no obvious reasons why the information would be withheld. The higher your check result, the better the information.

If you want to find out about a specific rumor, or a specific item, or obtain a map, or do something else along those lines, the DC for the check is 15 to 25, or even higher.
See also: epic usages of Gather Information.

Action:
A typical Gather Information check takes 1d4+1 hours.

Try Again:
Yes, but it takes time for each check. Furthermore, you may draw attention to yourself if you repeatedly pursue a certain type of information.

Special:
A half-elf has a +2 racial bonus on Gather Information checks.

If you have the Investigator feat, you get a +2 bonus on Gather Information checks.

Synergy:
If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (local), you get a +2 bonus on Gather Information checks.

Handle an Animal:
This task involves commanding an animal to perform a task or trick that it knows. If the animal is wounded or has taken any nonlethal damage or ability score damage, the DC increases by 2. If your check succeeds, the animal performs the task or trick on its next action.

"Push" an Animal:
To push an animal means to get it to perform a task or trick that it doesn't know but is physically capable of performing. This category also covers making an animal perform a forced march or forcing it to hustle for more than 1 hour between sleep cycles. If the animal is wounded or has taken any nonlethal damage or ability score damage, the DC increases by 2. If your check succeeds, the animal performs the task or trick on its next action.

Teach an Animal a Trick:
You can teach an animal a specific trick with one week of work and a successful Handle Animal check against the indicated DC. An animal with an Intelligence score of 1 can learn a maximum of three tricks, while an animal with an Intelligence score of 2 can learn a maximum of six tricks. Possible tricks (and their associated DCs) include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following.

Attack (DC 20): The animal attacks apparent enemies. You may point to a particular creature that you wish the animal to attack, and it will comply if able. Normally, an animal will attack only humanoids, monstrous humanoids, giants, or other animals. Teaching an animal to attack all creatures (including such unnatural creatures as undead and aberrations) counts as two tricks.

Come (DC 15): The animal comes to you, even if it normally would not do so.

Defend (DC 20): The animal defends you (or is ready to defend you if no threat is present), even without any command being given. Alternatively, you can command the animal to defend a specific other character.

Down (DC 15): The animal breaks off from combat or otherwise backs down. An animal that doesn't know this trick continues to fight until it must flee (due to injury, a fear effect, or the like) or its opponent is defeated.

Fetch (DC 15): The animal goes and gets something. If you do not point out a specific item, the animal fetches some random object.

Guard (DC 20): The animal stays in place and prevents others from approaching.

Heel (DC 15): The animal follows you closely, even to places where it normally wouldn't go.

Perform (DC 15): The animal performs a variety of simple tricks, such as sitting up, rolling over, roaring or barking, and so on.

Seek (DC 15): The animal moves into an area and looks around for anything that is obviously alive or animate.

Stay (DC 15): The animal stays in place, waiting for you to return. It does not challenge other creatures that come by, though it still defends itself if it needs to.

Track (DC 20): The animal tracks the scent presented to it. (This requires the animal to have the scent ability)

Work (DC 15): The animal pulls or pushes a medium or heavy load.

Train an Animal for a Purpose:
Rather than teaching an animal individual tricks, you can simply train it for a general purpose. Essentially, an animal's purpose represents a preselected set of known tricks that fit into a common scheme, such as guarding or heavy labor. The animal must meet all the normal prerequisites for all tricks included in the training package. If the package includes more than three tricks, the animal must have an Intelligence score of 2.

An animal can be trained for only one general purpose, though if the creature is capable of learning additional tricks (above and beyond those included in its general purpose), it may do so. Training an animal for a purpose requires fewer checks than teaching individual tricks does, but no less time.

Combat Riding (DC 20): An animal trained to bear a rider into combat knows the tricks attack, come, defend, down, guard, and heel. Training an animal for combat riding takes six weeks. You may also "upgrade" an animal trained for riding to one trained for combat riding by spending three weeks and making a successful DC 20 Handle Animal check. The new general purpose and tricks completely replace the animal's previous purpose and any tricks it once knew. Warhorses and riding dogs are already trained to bear riders into combat, and they don't require any additional training for this purpose.

Fighting (DC 20): An animal trained to engage in combat knows the tricks attack, down, and stay. Training an animal for fighting takes three weeks.

Guarding (DC 20): An animal trained to guard knows the tricks attack, defend, down, and guard. Training an animal for guarding takes four weeks.

Heavy Labor (DC 15): An animal trained for heavy labor knows the tricks come and work. Training an animal for heavy labor takes two weeks.

Hunting (DC 20): An animal trained for hunting knows the tricks attack, down, fetch, heel, seek, and track. Training an animal for hunting takes six weeks.

Performance (DC 15): An animal trained for performance knows the tricks come, fetch, heel, perform, and stay. Training an animal for performance takes five weeks.

Riding (DC 15): An animal trained to bear a rider knows the tricks come, heel, and stay. Training an animal for riding takes three weeks.

Rear a Wild Animal:
To rear an animal means to raise a wild creature from infancy so that it becomes domesticated. A handler can rear as many as three creatures of the same kind at once.

A successfully domesticated animal can be taught tricks at the same time it's being raised, or it can be taught as a domesticated animal later.

See also: epic usages of Handle Animal.

Action:
Varies. Handling an animal is a move action, while pushing an animal is a full-round action. (A druid or ranger can handle her animal companion as a free action or push it as a move action.) For tasks with specific time frames noted above, you must spend half this time (at the rate of 3 hours per day per animal being handled) working toward completion of the task before you attempt the Handle Animal check. If the check fails, your attempt to teach, rear, or train the animal fails and you need not complete the teaching, rearing, or training time. If the check succeeds, you must invest the remainder of the time to complete the teaching, rearing, or training. If the time is interrupted or the task is not followed through to completion, the attempt to teach, rear, or train the animal automatically fails.

Try Again:
Yes, except for rearing an animal.

Special:
You can use this skill on a creature with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 that is not an animal, but the DC of any such check increases by 5. Such creatures have the same limit on tricks known as animals do.

A druid or ranger gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Handle Animal checks involving her animal companion.

In addition, a druid's or ranger's animal companion knows one or more bonus tricks, which don't count against the normal limit on tricks known and don't require any training time or Handle Animal checks to teach.

If you have the Animal Affinity feat, you get a +2 bonus on Handle Animal checks.

Synergy:
If you have 5 or more ranks in Handle Animal, you get a +2 bonus on Ride checks and wild empathy checks.

Untrained:
If you have no ranks in Handle Animal, you can use a Charisma check to handle and push domestic animals, but you can't teach, rear, or train animals. A druid or ranger with no ranks in Handle Animal can use a Charisma check to handle and push her animal companion, but she can't teach, rear, or train other nondomestic animals. 
<32><16777248>:Heal
<33><16777249>:Heal (Wis)

Check:
The DC and effect depend on the task you attempt.

Task                        Heal DC
First aid                     15
Long-term care                15
Treat open wounds             15
Treat Poison             Poison's save DC
Treat disease            Disease's save DC

First Aid:
You usually use first aid to save a dying character. If a character has negative hit points and is losing hit points (at the rate of 1 per round, 1 per hour, or 1 per day), you can make him or her stable. A stable character regains no hit points but stops losing them.

Long-Term Care:
Providing long-term care means treating a wounded person for a day or more. If your Heal check is successful, the patient recovers hit points or ability score points (lost to ability damage) at twice the normal rate: 2 hit points per level for a full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 hit points per level for each full day of complete rest; 2 ability score points for a full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 ability score points for each full day of complete rest.

You can tend as many as six patients at a time. You need a few items and supplies (bandages, salves, and so on) that are easy to come by in settled lands. Giving long-term care counts as light activity for the healer. You cannot give long-term care to yourself.

Treat Wound from Caltrop, Spike Growth, or Spike Stones:
A creature wounded by stepping on a caltrop moves at one-half normal speed. A successful Heal check removes this movement penalty.

A creature wounded by a spike growth or spike stones spell must succeed on a Reflex save or take injuries that reduce his speed by one-third. Another character can remove this penalty by taking 10 minutes to dress the victim's injuries and succeeding on a Heal check against the spell's save DC.

Treat Poison:
To treat poison means to tend a single character who has been poisoned and who is going to take more damage from the poison (or suffer some other effect). Every time the poisoned character makes a saving throw against the poison, you make a Heal check. The poisoned character uses your check result or his or her saving throw, whichever is higher.

Treat Disease:
To treat a disease means to tend a single diseased character. Every time he or she makes a saving throw against disease effects, you make a Heal check. The diseased character uses your check result or his or her saving throw, whichever is higher.

See also: epic usages of Heal.

Action:
Providing first aid, treating a wound, or treating poison is a standard action. Treating a disease or tending a creature wounded by a spike growth or spike stones spell takes 10 minutes of work. Providing long-term care requires 8 hours of light activity.

Try Again:
Varies. Generally speaking, you can't try a Heal check again without proof of the original check's failure. You can always retry a check to provide first aid, assuming the target of the previous attempt is still alive.

Special:
A character with the Self-Sufficient feat gets a +2 bonus on Heal checks.

A healer's kit gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Heal checks. 
<34><16777250>:Hide
<35><16777251>:Hide (Dex; Armor Check Penalty)

Check:
Your Hide check is opposed by the Spot check of anyone who might see you. You can move up to one-half your normal speed and hide at no penalty. When moving at a speed greater than one-half but less than your normal speed, you take a -5 penalty. It's practically impossible (-20 penalty) to hide while attacking, running or charging.

A creature larger or smaller than Medium takes a size bonus or penalty on Hide checks depending on its size category: Fine +16, Diminutive +12, Tiny +8, Small +4, Large -4, Huge -8, Gargantuan -12, Colossal -16.

You need cover or concealment in order to attempt a Hide check. Total cover or total concealment usually (but not always; see Special, below) obviates the need for a Hide check, since nothing can see you anyway.

If people are observing you, even casually, you can't hide. You can run around a corner or behind cover so that you're out of sight and then hide, but the others then know at least where you went.

If your observers are momentarily distracted (such as by a Bluff check; see below), though, you can attempt to hide. While the others turn their attention from you, you can attempt a Hide check if you can get to a hiding place of some kind. (As a general guideline, the hiding place has to be within 1 foot per rank you have in Hide.) This check, however, is made at a -10 penalty because you have to move fast.

Sniping:
If you've already successfully hidden at least 10 feet from your target, you can make one ranged attack, then immediately hide again. You take a -20 penalty on your Hide check to conceal yourself after the shot.
Creating a Diversion to Hide

You can use Bluff to help you hide. A successful Bluff check can give you the momentary diversion you need to attempt a Hide check while people are aware of you.

See also: epic usages of Hide.

Action:
Usually none. Normally, you make a Hide check as part of movement, so it doesn't take a separate action. However, hiding immediately after a ranged attack (see Sniping, above) is a move action.

Special:
If you are invisible, you gain a +40 bonus on Hide checks if you are immobile, or a +20 bonus on Hide checks if you're moving.

If you have the Stealthy feat, you get a +2 bonus on Hide checks.

A 13th-level ranger can attempt a Hide check in any sort of natural terrain, even if it doesn't grant cover or concealment. A 17th-level ranger can do this even while being observed. 
<36><16777252>:Intimidate
<37><16777253>:Intimidate (Cha)

Check:
You can change another's behavior with a successful check. Your Intimidate check is opposed by the target's modified level check (1d20 + character level or Hit Dice + target's Wisdom bonus [if any] + target's modifiers on saves against fear). If you beat your target's check result, you may treat the target as friendly, but only for the purpose of actions taken while it remains intimidated. (That is, the target retains its normal attitude, but will chat, advise, offer limited help, or advocate on your behalf while intimidated. See the Diplomacy skill, above, for additional details.) The effect lasts as long as the target remains in your presence, and for 1d6×10 minutes afterward. After this time, the target's default attitude toward you shifts to unfriendly (or, if normally unfriendly, to hostile).

If you fail the check by 5 or more, the target provides you with incorrect or useless information, or otherwise frustrates your efforts.

Demoralize Opponent:
You can also use Intimidate to weaken an opponent's resolve in combat. To do so, make an Intimidate check opposed by the target's modified level check (see above). If you win, the target becomes shaken for 1 round. A shaken character takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. You can intimidate only an opponent that you threaten in melee combat and that can see you.

Action:
Varies. Changing another's behavior requires 1 minute of interaction. Intimidating an opponent in combat is a standard action.

Try Again:
Optional, but not recommended because retries usually do not work. Even if the initial check succeeds, the other character can be intimidated only so far, and a retry doesn't help. If the initial check fails, the other character has probably become more firmly resolved to resist the intimidator, and a retry is futile.

Special:
You gain a +4 bonus on your Intimidate check for every size category that you are larger than your target. Conversely, you take a -4 penalty on your Intimidate check for every size category that you are smaller than your target.

A character immune to fear can't be intimidated, nor can nonintelligent creatures.

If you have the Persuasive feat, you get a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks.

Synergy:
If you have 5 or more ranks in Bluff, you get a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks.

Jump (Str; Armor Check Penalty)

<b>Check</b>
The DC and the distance you can cover vary according to the type of jump you are attempting (see below).

Your Jump check is modified by your speed. If your speed is 30 feet then no modifier based on speed applies to the check. If your speed is less than 30 feet, you take a -6 penalty for every 10 feet of speed less than 30 feet. If your speed is greater than 30 feet, you gain a +4 bonus for every 10 feet beyond 30 feet.

All Jump DCs given here assume that you get a running start, which requires that you move at least 20 feet in a straight line before attempting the jump. If you do not get a running start, the DC for the jump is doubled.

Distance moved by jumping is counted against your normal maximum movement in a round.

If you have ranks in Jump and you succeed on a Jump check, you land on your feet (when appropriate). If you attempt a Jump check untrained, you land prone unless you beat the DC by 5 or more.

<i>Long Jump</i>
A long jump is a horizontal jump, made across a gap like a chasm or stream. At the midpoint of the jump, you attain a vertical height equal to one-quarter of the horizontal distance. The DC for the jump is equal to the distance jumped (in feet).

If your check succeeds, you land on your feet at the far end. If you fail the check by less than 5, you don't clear the distance, but you can make a DC 15 Reflex save to grab the far edge of the gap. You end your movement grasping the far edge. If that leaves you dangling over a chasm or gap, getting up requires a move action and a DC 15 Climb check.

<i>Long Jump DCs</i>
Long Jump Distance | Jump DC*
5 feet | DC 5
10 feet | DC 10
15 feet | DC 15
20 feet | DC 20
25 feet | DC 25
30 feet | DC 30
* Requires a 20-foot running start. Without a running start, double the DC.

<i>High Jump</i>
A high jump is a vertical leap made to reach a ledge high above or to grasp something overhead. The DC is equal to 4 times the distance to be cleared.

If you jumped up to grab something, a successful check indicates that you reached the desired height. If you wish to pull yourself up, you can do so with a move action and a DC 15 Climb check. If you fail the Jump check, you do not reach the height, and you land on your feet in the same spot from which you jumped. As with a long jump, the DC is doubled if you do not get a running start of at least 20 feet.

<i>High Jump DCs</i>
High Jump Distance* | Jump DC**
1 foot | DC 4
2 feet | DC 8
3 feet | DC 12
4 feet | DC 16
5 feet | DC 20
6 feet | DC 24
7 feet | DC 28
8 feet | DC 32
* Not including vertical reach; see below.
** Requires a 20-foot running start. Without a running start, double the DC.

Obviously, the difficulty of reaching a given height varies according to the size of the character or creature. The maximum vertical reach (height the creature can reach without jumping) for an average creature of a given size is shown on the table below. (As a Medium creature, a typical human can reach 8 feet without jumping.)

<i>Vertical Reach</i>
Creature Size | Vertical Reach
Colossal | 128 ft.
Gargantuan | 64 ft.
Huge | 32 ft.
Large | 16 ft.
Medium | 8 ft.
Small | 4 ft.
Tiny | 2 ft.
Diminutive | 1 ft.
Fine | 1/2 ft.

Quadrupedal creatures don't have the same vertical reach as a bipedal creature; treat them as being one size category smaller.

<i>Hop Up</i>
You can jump up onto an object as tall as your waist, such as a table or small boulder, with a DC 10 Jump check. Doing so counts as 10 feet of movement, so if your speed is 30 feet, you could move 20 feet, then hop up onto a counter. You do not need to get a running start to hop up, so the DC is not doubled if you do not get a running start.

<i>Jumping Down</i>
If you intentionally jump from a height, you take less damage than you would if you just fell. The DC to jump down from a height is 15. You do not have to get a running start to jump down, so the DC is not doubled if you do not get a running start.

If you succeed on the check, you take falling damage as if you had dropped 10 fewer feet than you actually did.

<b>Action</b>
None. A Jump check is included in your movement, so it is part of a move action. If you run out of movement mid-jump, your next action (either on this turn or, if necessary, on your next turn) must be a move action to complete the jump.

<b>Special</b>
Effects that increase your movement also increase your jumping distance, since your check is modified by your speed.

If you have the Run feat, you get a +4 bonus on Jump checks for any jumps made after a running start.

A halfling has a +2 racial bonus on Jump checks because halflings are agile and athletic.

If you have the Acrobatic feat, you get a +2 bonus on Jump checks.

<b>Synergy</b>
- If you have 5 or more ranks in Tumble, you get a +2 bonus on Jump checks.
- If you have 5 or more ranks in Jump, you get a +2 bonus on Tumble checks.

Check:
Answering a question within your field of study has a DC of 10 (for really easy questions), 15 (for basic questions), or 20 to 30 (for really tough questions).

In many cases, you can use this skill to identify monsters and their special powers or vulnerabilities. In general, the DC of such a check equals 10 + the monster's HD. A successful check allows you to remember a bit of useful information about that monster.

Listen DC  Sound
-10       A battle
  0       People talking (1)
  5       A person in medium armor walking at a slow pace (10ft/round) trying not to make any noise
 10       An unarmored person walking at a slow pace (15 ft/round) trying not to make any noise

In the case of people trying to be quiet, the DCs given on the table could be replaced by Move Silently checks, in which case the indicated DC would be their average check result.

See also: epic usages of Listen.

Action:
Varies. Every time you have a chance to hear something in a reactive manner (such as when someone makes a noise or you move into a new area), you can make a Listen check without using an action. Trying to hear something you failed to hear previously is a move action.

Try Again:
Yes. You can try to hear something that you failed to hear previously with no penalty.

Special:
When several characters are listening to the same thing, a single 1d20 roll can be used for all the individuals' Listen checks.

<60><16777276>:Move Silently
<61><16777277>:Move Silently (Dex; Armor Check Penalty)

Check:
Your Move Silently check is opposed by the Listen check of anyone who might hear you. You can move up to one-half your normal speed at no penalty. When moving at a speed greater than one-half but less than your full speed, you take a -5 penalty. It's practically impossible (-20 penalty) to move silently while running or charging.

Noisy surfaces, such as bogs or undergrowth, are tough to move silently across. When you try to sneak across such a surface, you take a penalty on your Move Silently check as indicated below.

Surface                                                        Check Modifier

<64><16777280>:Perform
<65><16777281>:<b>Perform (Cha)</b>

Like Craft, Knowledge, and Profession, Perform is actually a number of separate skills.

You could have several Perform skills, each with its own ranks, each purchased as a separate skill.

Each of the nine categories of the Perform skill includes a variety of methods, instruments, or techniques, a small list of which is provided for each category below.

- Act (comedy, drama, mime)
- Comedy (buffoonery, limericks, joke-telling)
- Dance (ballet, waltz, jig)
- Keyboard instruments (harpsichord, piano, pipe organ)
- Oratory (epic, ode, storytelling)
- Percussion instruments (bells, chimes, drums, gong)
- String instruments (fiddle, harp, lute, mandolin)
- Wind instruments (flute, pan pipes, recorder, shawm, trumpet)
- Sing (ballad, chant, melody)

<b>Check</b>
You can impress audiences with your talent and skill.
Perform DC | Performance
10 | Routine performance. Trying to earn money by playing in public is essentially begging. You can earn 1d10 cp/day.
15 | Enjoyable performance. In a prosperous city, you can earn 1d10 sp/day.
20 | Great performance. In a prosperous city, you can earn 3d10 sp/day. In time, you may be invited to join a professional troupe and may develop a regional reputation.
25 | Memorable performance. In a prosperous city, you can earn 1d6 gp/day. In time, you may come to the attention of noble patrons and develop a national reputation.
30 | Extraordinary performance. In a prosperous city, you can earn 3d6 gp/day. In time, you may draw attention from distant potential patrons, or even from extraplanar beings.

A masterwork musical instrument gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Perform checks that involve its use.

<b>Action</b>
Varies. Trying to earn money by playing in public requires anywhere from an evening's work to a full day's performance. The bard's special Perform-based abilities are described in that class's description.

<b>Try Again</b>
Yes. Retries are allowed, but they don't negate previous failures, and an audience that has been unimpressed in the past is likely to be prejudiced against future performances. (Increase the DC by 2 for each previous failure.)

<b>Special</b>
A bard must have at least 3 ranks in a Perform skill to inspire courage in his allies, or to use his countersong or his fascinate ability. A bard needs 6 ranks in a Perform skill to inspire competence, 9 ranks to use his suggestion ability, 12 ranks to inspire greatness, 15 ranks to use his song of freedom ability, 18 ranks to inspire heroics, and 21 ranks to use his mass suggestion ability. See Bardic Music in the bard class description.

In addition to using the Perform skill, you can entertain people with sleight of hand, tumbling, tightrope walking, and spells (especially illusions).

<67><16777283>:<b><i>NOTE: This skill is primarily usable with DM assistance, and as such, may be less frequently useable than hardcoded skills directly referenced by the game engine.</i></b>


<b>Ride (Dex)</b>

If you attempt to ride a creature that is ill suited as a mount, you take a -5 penalty on your Ride checks.

<b>Check</b>
Typical riding actions don't require checks. You can saddle, mount, ride, and dismount from a mount without a problem.

The following tasks do require checks.

Ride DCs Task Ride DC
Guide with knees 5
Stay in saddle 5
Fight with warhorse 10
Cover 15
Soft fall 15
Leap 15
Spur mount 15
Control mount in battle 20
Fast mount or dismount 20*
* Armor check penalty applies.

<i>Guide with Knees</i>
You can react instantly to guide your mount with your knees so that you can use both hands in combat. Make your Ride check at the start of your turn. If you fail, you can use only one hand this round because you need to use the other to control your mount.

<i>Stay in Saddle</i>
You can react instantly to try to avoid falling when your mount rears or bolts unexpectedly or when you take damage. This usage does not take an action.

<i>Fight with Warhorse</i>
If you direct your war-trained mount to attack in battle, you can still make your own attack or attacks normally. This usage is a free action.

<i>Cover</i>
You can react instantly to drop down and hang alongside your mount, using it as cover. You can't attack or cast spells while using your mount as cover. If you fail your Ride check, you don't get the cover benefit. This usage does not take an action.

<i>Soft Fall</i>
You can react instantly to try to take no damage when you fall off a mount -- when it is killed or when it falls, for example. If you fail your Ride check, you take 1d6 points of falling damage. This usage does not take an action.

<i>Leap</i>
You can get your mount to leap obstacles as part of its movement. Use your Ride modifier or the mount's Jump modifier, whichever is lower, to see how far the creature can jump. If you fail your Ride check, you fall off the mount when it leaps and take the appropriate falling damage (at least 1d6 points). This usage does not take an action, but is part of the mount's movement.

<i>Spur Mount</i>
You can spur your mount to greater speed with a move action. A successful Ride check increases the mount's speed by 10 feet for 1 round but deals 1 point of damage to the creature. You can use this ability every round, but each consecutive round of additional speed deals twice as much damage to the mount as the previous round (2 points, 4 points, 8 points, and so on).

<i>Control Mount in Battle</i>
As a move action, you can attempt to control a light horse, pony, heavy horse, or other mount not trained for combat riding while in battle. If you fail the Ride check, you can do nothing else in that round. You do not need to roll for warhorses or warponies.

<i>Fast Mount or Dismount</i>
You can attempt to mount or dismount from a mount of up to one size category larger than yourself as a free action, provided that you still have a move action available that round. If you fail the Ride check, mounting or dismounting is a move action. You can't use fast mount or dismount on a mount more than one size category larger than yourself.

<b>Action</b>
Varies. Mounting or dismounting normally is a move action. Other checks are a move action, a free action, or no action at all, as noted above.

<b>Special</b>
If you are riding bareback, you take a -5 penalty on Ride checks.

If your mount has a military saddle you get a +2 circumstance bonus on Ride checks related to staying in the saddle.

The Ride skill is a prerequisite for the feats Mounted Archery, Mounted Combat, Ride-By Attack, Spirited Charge, Trample.

If you have the Animal Affinity feat, you get a +2 bonus on Ride checks.

<b>Synergy</b>
If you have 5 or more ranks in Handle Animal, you get a +2 bonus on Ride checks. 
<68><16777284>:Search
<69><16777285>:Search (Int)

Check:
You generally must be within 10 feet of the object or surface to be searched. The table below gives DCs for typical tasks involving the Search skill.

See also: epic usages of Search.

Task                                                             Search DC
Ransack a chest full of junk to find a certain item              10
Notice a typical secret door or a simple trap                    20
Find a difficult non-magical trap (rogue only) (1)               21 or higher
Find a magic trap (rogue only) (1)                               25 + level of spell used to create trap
Notice a well-hidden secret door                                 30
Find a footprint                                                 Varies (2)

(1) Dwarves (even if they are not rogues) can use Search to find traps built into or out of stone.
(2) A successful search check can find a footprint or similar sign of a creature's passage, but it won't let you find or follow a trail. See the Track feat for the appropriate DC.

Action:
It takes a full-round action to search a 5-foot-by-5-foot area or a volume of goods 5 feet on a side.

Special:
An elf has a +2 racial bonus on Search checks, and a half-elf has a +1 racial bonus. An elf (but not a half-elf) who simply passes within 5 feet of a secret or concealed door can make a Search check to find that door.

If you have the Investigator feat, you get a +2 bonus on Search checks.

The spells explosive runes, fire trap, glyph of warding, symbol, and teleportation circle create magic traps that a rogue can find by making a successful Search check and then can attempt to disarm by using Disable Device. Identifying the location of a snare spell has a DC of 23. Spike growth and spike stones create magic traps that can be found using Search, but against which Disable Device checks do not succeed. See the individual spell descriptions for details.

Active abjuration spells within 10 feet of each other for 24 hours or more create barely visible energy fluctuations. These fluctuations give you a +4 bonus on Search checks to locate such abjuration spells.

Synergy:
If you have 5 or more ranks in Search, you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks to find or follow tracks.
If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (architecture and engineering), you get a +2 bonus on Search checks to find secret doors or hidden compartments.

Restriction:
While anyone can use Search to find a trap whose DC is 20 or lower, only a rogue can use Search to locate traps with higher DCs. (Exception: The spell find traps temporarily enables a cleric to use the Search skill as if he were a rogue.)

A dwarf, even one who is not a rogue, can use the Search skill to find a difficult trap (one with a DC higher than 20) if the trap is built into or out of stone. He gains a +2 racial bonus on the Search check from his stonecunning ability. 
<70><16777286>:Sense Motive
<71><16777287>:<b><i>NOTE: This skill is primarily usable with DM assistance, and as such, may be less frequently useable than hardcoded skills directly referenced by the game engine.</b></i>

Sense Motive (Wis)

Check:
A successful check lets you avoid being bluffed. You can also use this skill to determine when "something is up" (that is, something odd is going on) or to assess someone's trustworthiness.
Sense Motive DCs 
Task                    Sense Motive DC
Hunch                   20
Sense enchantment       25 or 15
Discern secret message  Varies

Hunch:
This use of the skill involves making a gut assessment of the social situation. You can get the feeling from another's behavior that something is wrong, such as when you're talking to an impostor. Alternatively, you can get the feeling that someone is trustworthy.

Sense Enchantment:
You can tell that someone's behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect (by definition, a mind-affecting effect), even if that person isn't aware of it. The usual DC is 25, but if the target is dominated (see dominate person), the DC is only 15 because of the limited range of the target's activities.

Discern Secret Message:
You may use Sense Motive to detect that a hidden message is being transmitted via the Bluff skill. In this case, your Sense Motive check is opposed by the Bluff check of the character transmitting the message. For each piece of information relating to the message that you are missing, you take a -2 penalty on your Sense Motive check. If you succeed by 4 or less, you know that something hidden is being communicated, but you can't learn anything specific about its content. If you beat the DC by 5 or more, you intercept and understand the message. If you fail by 4 or less, you don't detect any hidden communication. If you fail by 5 or more, you infer some false information.

See also: epic usages of Sense Motive.

Action:
Trying to gain information with Sense Motive generally takes at least 1 minute, and you could spend a whole evening trying to get a sense of the people around you.

Try Again:
No, though you may make a Sense Motive check for each Bluff check made against you.

Special:
A ranger gains a bonus on Sense Motive checks when using this skill against a favored enemy.

If you have the Negotiator feat, you get a +2 bonus on Sense Motive checks.

Synergy:
If you have 5 or more ranks in Sense Motive, you get a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks. 
<72><16777288>:Sleight of Hand
<73><16777289>:Sleight Of Hand (Dex; Trained Only; Armor Check Penalty)

Check:
A DC 10 Sleight of Hand check lets you palm a coin-sized, unattended object. Performing a minor feat of legerdemain, such as making a coin disappear, also has a DC of 10 unless an observer is determined to note where the item went.

When you use this skill under close observation, your skill check is opposed by the observer's Spot check. The observer's success doesn't prevent you from performing the action, just from doing it unnoticed.

You can hide a small object (including a light weapon or an easily concealed ranged weapon, such as a dart, sling, or hand crossbow) on your body. Your Sleight of Hand check is opposed by the Spot check of anyone observing you or the Search check of anyone frisking you. In the latter case, the searcher gains a +4 bonus on the Search check, since it's generally easier to find such an object than to hide it. A dagger is easier to hide than most light weapons, and grants you a +2 bonus on your Sleight of Hand check to conceal it. An extraordinarily small object, such as a coin, shuriken, or ring, grants you a +4 bonus on your Sleight of Hand check to conceal it, and heavy or baggy clothing (such as a cloak) grants you a +2 bonus on the check.

Drawing a hidden weapon is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity.

If you try to take something from another creature, you must make a DC 20 Sleight of Hand check to obtain it. The opponent makes a Spot check to detect the attempt, opposed by the same Sleight of Hand check result you achieved when you tried to grab the item. An opponent who succeeds on this check notices the attempt, regardless of whether you got the item.

You can also use Sleight of Hand to entertain an audience as though you were using the Perform skill. In such a case, your "act" encompasses elements of legerdemain, juggling, and the like.

See also: epic usages of Sleight Of Hand.

Sleight of Hand DCs
Sleight of Hand DC       Task
10                       Palm a coin-sized object, make a coin disappear
20                       Lift a small object from a person

Action:
Any Sleight of Hand check normally is a standard action. However, you may perform a Sleight of Hand check as a free action by taking a -20 penalty on the check.

Try Again:
Yes, but after an initial failure, a second Sleight of Hand attempt against the same target (or while you are being watched by the same observer who noticed your previous attempt) increases the DC for the task by 10.

Special:
If you have the Deft Hands feat, you get a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks.

Synergy:
If you have 5 or more ranks in Bluff, you get a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks.

Untrained:
An untrained Sleight of Hand check is simply a Dexterity check. Without actual training, you can't succeed on any Sleight of Hand check with a DC higher than 10, except for hiding an object on your body.

Try Again:
Not applicable. There are no Speak Language checks to fail.

The Speak Language skill doesn't work like other skills. Languages work as follows.

*You start at 1st level knowing one or two languages (based on your race), plus an additional number of languages equal to your starting Intelligence bonus.
*You can purchase Speak Language just like any other skill, but instead of buying a rank in it, you choose a new language that you can speak.
*You don't make Speak Language checks. You either know a language or you don't.
*A literate character (anyone but a barbarian who has not spent skill points to become literate) can read and write any language she speaks. Each language has an alphabet, though sometimes several spoken languages share a single alphabet.

<76><16777292>:Spellcraft
<77><16777293>:Spellcraft (Int; Trained Only)

Use this skill to identify spells as they are cast or spells already in place.

Check:
You can identify spells and magic effects. The DCs for Spellcraft checks relating to various tasks are summarized on the table below.

Spellcraft DC 	      Task
13                    When using read magic, identify a glyph of warding. No action required.
15 + spell level      Identify a spell being cast. (You must see or hear the spell's verbal or somatic
                      components.) No action required. No retry.
15 + spell level      Learn a spell from a spellbook or scroll (wizard only). No retry for that spell until you 
                      gain at least 1 rank in Spellcraft (even if you find another source to try to learn the 
                      spell from). Requires 8 hours.
15 + spell level      Prepare a spell from a borrowed spellbook (wizard only). One try per day. No extra time 
                      required.

                      item or creature you can see. (If the aura is not a spell effect, the DC is 15 + one-half 
                      caster level.) No action required.
19                    When using read magic, identify a symbol. No action required.
20 + spell level      Identify a spell that's already in place and in effect. You must be able to see or detect 
                      the effects of the spell. No action required. No retry.
20 + spell level      Identify materials created or shaped by magic, such as noting that an iron wall is the

20                    Draw a diagram to allow dimensional anchor to be cast on a magic circle spell. Requires 10                       minutes. No retry. This check is made secretly so you do not know the result.
30 or higher          Understand a strange or unique magical effect, such as the effects of a magic stream. Time                       required varies. No retry.

See also: epic usages of Spellcraft.

Action:
Varies, as noted above.

Try Again:
See above.

Special:
If you are a specialist wizard, you get a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks when dealing with a spell or effect from your specialty school. You take a -5 penalty when dealing with a spell or effect from a prohibited school (and some tasks, such as learning a prohibited spell, are just impossible).

If you have the Magical Aptitude feat, you get a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks.

Synergy:
* If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (arcana), you get a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks.
* If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Magic Device, you get a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks to decipher spells on scrolls.
* If you have 5 or more ranks in Spellcraft, you get a +2 bonus on Use Magic Device checks related to scrolls.

Additionally, certain spells allow you to gain information about magic, provided that you make a successful Spellcraft check as detailed in the spell description. 
<78><16777294>:Spot
<79><16777295>:Spot (Wis)

Check:
The Spot skill is used primarily to detect characters or creatures who are hiding. Typically, your Spot check is opposed by the Hide check of the creature trying not to be seen. Sometimes a creature isn't intentionally hiding but is still difficult to see, so a successful Spot check is necessary to notice it.

A Spot check result higher than 20 generally lets you become aware of an invisible creature near you, though you can't actually see it.

Spot is also used to detect someone in disguise, and to read lips when you can't hear or understand what someone is saying.

Spot checks may be called for to determine the distance at which an encounter begins. A penalty applies on such checks, depending on the distance between the two individuals or groups, and an additional penalty may apply if the character making the Spot check is distracted (not concentrating on being observant).

Spot Check Penalties:
Condition                  Penalty
Per 10 feet of distance    -1
Spotter distracted         -5

Read Lips:
To understand what someone is saying by reading lips, you must be within 30 feet of the speaker, be able to see him or her speak, and understand the speaker's language. (This use of the skill is language-dependent.) The base DC is 15, but it increases for complex speech or an inarticulate speaker. You must maintain a line of sight to the lips being read.

If your Spot check succeeds, you can understand the general content of a minute's worth of speaking, but you usually still miss certain details. If the check fails by 4 or less, you can't read the speaker's lips. If the check fails by 5 or more, you draw some incorrect conclusion about the speech. The check is rolled secretly in this case, so that you don't know whether you succeeded or missed by 5.

See also: epic usages of Spot.

Action:
Varies. Every time you have a chance to spot something in a reactive manner you can make a Spot check without using an action. Trying to spot something you failed to see previously is a move action. To read lips, you must concentrate for a full minute before making a Spot check, and you can't perform any other action (other than moving at up to half speed) during this minute.

Try Again:
Yes. You can try to spot something that you failed to see previously at no penalty. You can attempt to read lips once per minute.

Special:
A fascinated creature takes a -4 penalty on Spot checks made as reactions.

If you have the Alertness feat, you get a +2 bonus on Spot checks.

A ranger gains a bonus on Spot checks when using this skill against a favored enemy.

An elf has a +2 racial bonus on Spot checks.

A half-elf has a +1 racial bonus on Spot checks.

The master of a hawk familiar gains a +3 bonus on Spot checks in daylight or other lighted areas.

The master of an owl familiar gains a +3 bonus on Spot checks in shadowy or other darkened areas. 
<80><16777296>:Survival
<81><16777297>:Survival (Wis)

Check:
You can keep yourself and others safe and fed in the wild. The table below gives the DCs for various tasks that require Survival checks.

Survival does not allow you to follow difficult tracks unless you are a ranger or have the Track feat (see the Restriction section below).

Survival DC      Task
10               Get along in the wild. Move up to one-half your overland speed while hunting and foraging (no 
                 food or water supplies needed). You can provide food and water for one other person for every 2                  points by which your check result exceeds 10.
15               Gain a +2 bonus on all Fortitude saves against severe weather while moving up to one-half your 
                 overland speed, or gain a +4 bonus if you remain stationary. You may grant the same bonus to 
                 one other character for every 1 point by which your Survival check result exceeds 15.
15               Keep from getting lost or avoid natural hazards, such as quicksand.
15               Predict the weather up to 24 hours in advance. For every 5 points by which your Survival check 
                 result exceeds 15, you can predict the weather for one additional day in advance.
Varies           Follow tracks (see the Track feat).

See also: epic usages of Survival.

Action:
Varies. A single Survival check may represent activity over the course of hours or a full day. A Survival check made to find tracks is at least a full-round action, and it may take even longer.

Try Again:
Varies. For getting along in the wild or for gaining the Fortitude save bonus noted in the table above, you make a Survival check once every 24 hours. The result of that check applies until the next check is made. To avoid getting lost or avoid natural hazards, you make a Survival check whenever the situation calls for one. Retries to avoid getting lost in a specific situation or to avoid a specific natural hazard are not allowed. For finding tracks, you can retry a failed check after 1 hour (outdoors) or 10 minutes(indoors) of searching.

Restriction:
While anyone can use Survival to find tracks (regardless of the DC), or to follow tracks when the DC for the task is 10 or lower, only a ranger (or a character with the Track feat) can use Survival to follow tracks when the task has a higher DC.

Special:
If you have 5 or more ranks in Survival, you can automatically determine where true north lies in relation to yourself.

A ranger gains a bonus on Survival checks when using this skill to find or follow the tracks of a favored enemy.

If you have the Self-Sufficient feat, you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks.

Synergy:
If you have 5 or more ranks in Survival, you get a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) checks.
If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (dungeoneering), you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks made while underground.
If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (nature), you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks in aboveground natural environments (aquatic, desert, forest, hill, marsh, mountains, and plains).
If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (geography), you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks made to keep from getting lost or to avoid natural hazards.
If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (the planes), you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks made while on other planes.
If you have 5 or more ranks in Search, you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks to find or follow tracks.

<82><16777298>:Swim
<83><16777299>:<b><i>NOTE: This skill is primarily usable with DM assistance, and as such, may be less frequently useable than hardcoded skills directly referenced by the game engine.</b></i>

Swim (Str; Armor Check Penalty)

Check:
Make a Swim check once per round while you are in the water. Success means you may swim at up to one-half your speed (as a full-round action) or at one-quarter your speed (as a move action). If you fail by 4 or less, you make no progress through the water. If you fail by 5 or more, you go underwater.

If you are underwater, either because you failed a Swim check or because you are swimming underwater intentionally, you must hold your breath. You can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to twice your Constitution score, but only if you do nothing other than take move actions or free actions. If you take a standard action or a full-round action (such as making an attack), the remainder of the duration for which you can hold your breath is reduced by 1 round. (Effectively, a character in combat can hold his or her breath only half as long as normal.) After that period of time, you must make a DC 10 Constitution check every round to continue holding your breath. Each round, the DC for that check increases by 1. If you fail the Constitution check, you begin to drown.

The DC for the Swim check depends on the water, as given on the table below.

Swim DCs:
Water           Swim DC

Calm water      10
Rough water     15
Stormy water    20(1)

(1) You can't take 10 on a Swim check in stormy water, even if you aren't otherwise being threatened or distracted.

Each hour that you swim, you must make a DC 20 Swim check or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage from fatigue.

See also: epic usages of Swim.

Action:
A successful Swim check allows you to swim one-quarter of your speed as a move action or one-half your speed as a full-round action.

Special:
Swim checks are subject to double the normal armor check penalty and encumbrance penalty.

If you have the Athletic feat, you get a +2 bonus on Swim checks.

If you have the Endurance feat, you get a +4 bonus on Swim checks made to avoid taking nonlethal damage from fatigue.

A creature with a swim speed can move through water at its indicated speed without making Swim checks. It gains a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform a special action or avoid a hazard. The creature always can choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered when swimming. Such a creature can use the run action while swimming, provided that it swims in a straight line. 
<84><16777300>:Tumble
<85><16777301>:Tumble (Dex; Trained Only; Armor Check Penalty)

You can't use this skill if your speed has been reduced by armor, excess equipment, or loot.

Check:
You can land softly when you fall or tumble past opponents. You can also tumble to entertain an audience (as though using the Perform skill). The DCs for various tasks involving the Tumble skill are given on the table below.

Tumble DC            Task
15                   Treat a fall as if it were 10 feet shorter than it really is when determining damage.
15                   Tumble at one-half speed as part of normal movement, provoking no attacks of opportunity 
                     while doing so. Failure means you provoke attacks of opportunity normally. Check separately                      for each opponent you move past, in the order in which you pass them (player's choice of 
                     order in case of a tie). Each additional enemy after the first adds +2 to the Tumble DC.
25                   Tumble at one-half speed through an area occupied by an enemy (over, under, or around the 
                     opponent) as part of normal movement, provoking no attacks of opportunity while doing so. 
                     Failure means you stop before entering the enemy-occupied area and provoke an attack of 
                     opportunity from that enemy. Check separately for each opponent. Each additional enemy 
                     after the first adds +2 to the Tumble DC.

Obstructed or otherwise treacherous surfaces, such as natural cavern floors or undergrowth, are tough to tumble through. The DC for any Tumble check made to tumble into such a square is modified as indicated below.

Surface Is…                                                                   DC Modifier

Lightly obstructed (scree, light rubble, shallow bog(1), undergrowth)          +2
Severely obstructed (natural cavern floor, dense rubble, dense undergrowth)    +5
Lightly slippery (wet floor)                                                   +2
Severely slippery (ice sheet)                                                  +5
Sloped or angled                                                               +2

(1) Tumbling is impossible in a deep bog.

Accelerated Tumbling:
You try to tumble past or through enemies more quickly than normal. By accepting a -10 penalty on your Tumble checks, you can move at your full speed instead of one-half your speed.

See also: epic usages of Tumble.

Action:
Not applicable. Tumbling is part of movement, so a Tumble check is part of a move action.

Try Again:
Usually no. An audience, once it has judged a tumbler as an uninteresting performer, is not receptive to repeat performances.

You can try to reduce damage from a fall as an instant reaction only once per fall.

Special:
If you have 5 or more ranks in Tumble, you gain a +3 dodge bonus to AC when fighting defensively instead of the usual +2 dodge bonus to AC.

If you have 5 or more ranks in Tumble, you gain a +6 dodge bonus to AC when executing the total defense standard action instead of the usual +4 dodge bonus to AC.

If you have the Acrobatic feat, you get a +2 bonus on Tumble checks.

Synergy:
If you have 5 or more ranks in Tumble, you get a +2 bonus on Balance and Jump checks.
If you have 5 or more ranks in Jump, you get a +2 bonus on Tumble checks.

<86><16777302>:Use Magic Device
<87><16777303>:Use Magic Device (Cha; Trained Only)

Use this skill to activate magic

Check:
You can use this skill to read a spell or to activate a magic item. Use Magic Device lets you use a magic item as if you had the spell ability or class features of another class, as if you were a different race, or as if you were of a different alignment.

You make a Use Magic Device check each time you activate a device such as a wand. If you are using the check to emulate an alignment or some other quality in an ongoing manner, you need to make the relevant Use Magic Device check once per hour.

You must consciously choose which requirement to emulate. That is, you must know what you are trying to emulate when you make a Use Magic Device check for that purpose. The DCs for various tasks involving Use Magic Device checks are summarized on the table below.

Use Magic Device DCs:
Task                           Use Magic Device DC
Activate blindly               25
Decipher a written spell       25 + spell level
Use a scroll                   20 + caster level
Use a wand                     20
Emulate a class feature        20
Emulate an ability score       See text
Emulate a race                 25
Emulate an alignment           30

Activate Blindly:
Some magic items are activated by special words, thoughts, or actions. You can activate such an item as if you were using the activation word, thought, or action, even when you're not and even if you don't know it. You do have to perform some equivalent activity in order to make the check. That is, you must speak, wave the item around, or otherwise attempt to get it to activate. You get a special +2 bonus on your Use Magic Device check if you've activated the item in question at least once before. If you fail by 9 or less, you can't activate the device. If you fail by 10 or more, you suffer a mishap. A mishap means that magical energy gets released but it doesn't do what you wanted it to do. The default mishaps are that the item affects the wrong target or that uncontrolled magical energy is released, dealing 2d6 points of damage to you. This mishap is in addition to the chance for a mishap that you normally run when you cast a spell from a scroll that you could not otherwise cast yourself.

Decipher a Written Spell:
This usage works just like deciphering a written spell with the Spellcraft skill, except that the DC is 5 points higher. Deciphering a written spell requires 1 minute of concentration.

Emulate an Ability Score:
To cast a spell from a scroll, you need a high score in the appropriate ability (Intelligence for wizard spells, Wisdom for divine spells, or Charisma for sorcerer or bard spells). Your effective ability score (appropriate to the class you're emulating when you try to cast the spell from the scroll) is your Use Magic Device check result minus 15. If you already have a high enough score in the appropriate ability, you don't need to make this check.

Emulate an Alignment:
Some magic items have positive or negative effects based on the user's alignment. Use Magic Device lets you use these items as if you were of an alignment of your choice. You can emulate only one alignment at a time.

Emulate a Class Feature:
Sometimes you need to use a class feature to activate a magic item. In this case, your effective level in the emulated class equals your Use Magic Device check result minus 20. This skill does not let you actually use the class feature of another class. It just lets you activate items as if you had that class feature. If the class whose feature you are emulating has an alignment requirement, you must meet it, either honestly or by emulating an appropriate alignment with a separate Use Magic Device check (see above).

Emulate a Race:
Some magic items work only for members of certain races, or work better for members of those races. You can use such an item as if you were a race of your choice. You can emulate only one race at a time.

Use a Scroll:
If you are casting a spell from a scroll, you have to decipher it first. Normally, to cast a spell from a scroll, you must have the scroll's spell on your class spell list. Use Magic Device allows you to use a scroll as if you had a particular spell on your class spell list. The DC is equal to 20 + the caster level of the spell you are trying to cast from the scroll. In addition, casting a spell from a scroll requires a minimum score (10 + spell level) in the appropriate ability. If you don't have a sufficient score in that ability, you must emulate the ability score with a separate Use Magic Device check (see above).

This use of the skill also applies to other spell completion magic items.

Use a Wand:
Normally, to use a wand, you must have the wand's spell on your class spell list. This use of the skill allows you to use a wand as if you had a particular spell on your class spell list. This use of the skill also applies to other spell trigger magic items, such as staffs.

Action:
None. The Use Magic Device check is made as part of the action (if any) required to activate the magic item.

Try Again:
Yes, but if you ever roll a natural 1 while attempting to activate an item and you fail, then you can't try to activate that item again for 24 hours.

Special:
You cannot take 10 with this skill.

You can't aid another on Use Magic Device checks. Only the user of the item may attempt such a check.

If you have the Magical Aptitude feat, you get a +2 bonus on Use Magic Device checks.

Synergy:
If you have 5 or more ranks in Spellcraft, you get a +2 bonus on Use Magic Device checks related to scrolls.
If you have 5 or more ranks in Decipher Script, you get a +2 bonus on Use Magic Device checks related to scrolls.
If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Magic Device, you get a +2 bonus to Spellcraft checks made to decipher spells on scrolls.

<89><16777305>:<b><i>NOTE: This skill is primarily usable with DM assistance, and as such, may be less frequently useable than hardcoded skills directly referenced by the game engine.</b></i>

Use Rope (Dex)

Check:
Most tasks with a rope are relatively simple. The DCs for various tasks utilizing this skill are summarized on the table below.

Use Rope DCs:
Use Rope DC       Task
10                Tie a firm knot
10                Secure a grappling hook (1)
15                Tie a special knot, such as one that slips,
                  slides slowly, or loosens with a tug
15                Tie a rope around yourself one-handed
15                Splice two ropes together
Varies            Bind a character

1. Add 2 to the DC for every 10 feet the hook is thrown; see below.

Secure a Grappling Hook:
Securing a grappling hook requires a Use Rope check (DC 10, +2 for every 10 feet of distance the grappling hook is thrown, to a maximum DC of 20 at 50 feet). Failure by 4 or less indicates that the hook fails to catch and falls, allowing you to try again. Failure by 5 or more indicates that the grappling hook initially holds, but comes loose after 1d4 rounds of supporting weight. This check is made secretly, so that you don't know whether the rope will hold your weight.

Bind a Character:
When you bind another character with a rope, any Escape Artist check that the bound character makes is opposed by your Use Rope check.

You get a +10 bonus on this check because it is easier to bind someone than to escape from bonds. You don't even make your Use Rope check until someone tries to escape.

See also: epic usages of Use Rope.

Action:
Varies. Throwing a grappling hook is a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Tying a knot, tying a special knot, or tying a rope around yourself one-handed is a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Splicing two ropes together takes 5 minutes. Binding a character takes 1 minute.

Special:
A silk rope gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Use Rope checks. If you cast an animate rope spell on a rope, you get a +2 circumstance bonus on any Use Rope checks you make when using that rope.

These bonuses stack.

If you have the Deft Hands feat, you get a +2 bonus on Use Rope checks.

Synergy:
If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Rope, you get a +2 bonus on Climb checks made to climb a rope, a knotted rope, or a rope-and-wall combination.
If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Rope, you get a +2 bonus on Escape Artist checks when escaping from rope bonds.
If you have 5 or more ranks in Escape Artist, you get a +2 bonus on checks made to bind someone.

Profession (Wis; Trained Only)

While a craft skill represents ability in creating or making an item, a Profession skill represents an aptitude in a vocation requiring a broader range of less specific knowledge.  To draw a modern analogy, if an occupation is a service industry, it's probably a Profession skill.

You may discuss which Profession points invested in this skill represent with your DMs.

Knowledge(local) (Int; Trained Only)

Like the Craft and Profession skills, Knowledge actually encompasses a number of unrelated skills. Knowledge represents a study of some body of lore, possibly an academic or even scientific discipline.

Below are listed typical fields of study.

Local (legends, personalities, inhabitants, laws, customs, traditions, humanoids)

Check:
Answering a question within your field of study has a DC of 10 (for really easy questions), 15 (for basic questions), or 20 to 30 (for really tough questions).

In many cases, you can use this skill to identify monsters and their special powers or vulnerabilities. In general, the DC of such a check equals 10 + the monster's HD. A successful check allows you to remember a bit of useful information about that monster.

For every 5 points by which your check result exceeds the DC, you recall another piece of useful information.

Action:
Usually none. In most cases, making a Knowledge check doesn't take an action—you simply know the answer or you don't.

Try Again:
No. The check represents what you know, and thinking about a topic a second time doesn't let you know something that you never learned in the first place.

Synergy:
If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (local), you get a +2 bonus on Gather Information checks.

Untrained:
An untrained Knowledge check is simply an Intelligence check. Without actual training, you know only common knowledge (DC 10 or lower).

<784><16778000>:Wild Empathy
<785><16778001>:NOTE: This feat has no direct in-game effect, and is unly usable at the discretion of a DM.

A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person. The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result.

The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.

To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.

A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check. 
<786><16778002>:Timeless Body
<787><16778003>:NOTE: This feat has no direct in-game effect, and is unly usable at the discretion of a DM.

After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place.

Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.
<788><16778004>:A Thousand Faces
<789><16778005>:NOTE: This feat has no direct in-game effect, and is unly usable at the discretion of a DM.

At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the disguise self spell, but only while in her normal form. This affects the druid's body but not her possessions. It is not an illusory effect, but a minor physical alteration of the druid's appearance, within the limits described for the spell.

Target: You
Duration: See text

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect. Any effects of this spell must be roleplayed out. Inform your DM before you prepare the spell.

Legend lore brings to your mind legends about an important person, place, or thing. If the person or thing is at hand, or if you are in the place in question, the casting time is only 1d4×10 minutes. If you have only detailed information on the person, place, or thing, the casting time is 1d10 days, and the resulting lore is less complete and specific (though it often provides enough information to help you find the person, place, or thing, thus allowing a better legend lore result next time). If you know only rumors, the casting time is 2d6 weeks, and the resulting lore is vague and incomplete (though it often directs you to more detailed information, thus allowing a better legend lore result next time).

During the casting, you cannot engage in other than routine activities: eating, sleeping, and so forth. When completed, the divination brings legends (if any) about the person, place, or things to your mind. These may be legends that are still current, legends that have been forgotten, or even information that has never been generally known. If the person, place, or thing is not of legendary importance, you gain no information. As a rule of thumb, characters who are 11th level and higher are "legendary," as are the sorts of creatures they contend with, the major magic items they wield, and the places where they perform their key deeds.

Incense worth at least 250 gp.

Effect: Magical sensor
Duration: 1 min./level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect. Any effects of this spell must be roleplayed out. Inform your DM before you prepare the spell.

Clairaudience/clairvoyance creates an invisible magical sensor at a specific location that enables you to hear or see (your choice) almost as if you were there. You don't need line of sight or line of effect, but the locale must be known—a place familiar to you or an obvious one. Once you have selected the locale, the sensor doesn't move, but you can rotate it in all directions to view the area as desired. Unlike other scrying spells, this spell does not allow magically or supernaturally enhanced senses to work through it. If the chosen locale is magically dark, you see nothing. If it is naturally pitch black, you can see in a 10-foot radius around the center of the spell's effect. Clairaudience/clairvoyance functions only on the plane of existence you are currently occupying.
Arcane Focus

A small horn (for hearing) or a glass eye (for seeing).

Duration: 1 hour/level
Saving Throw: Will negates
Spell Resistance: Yes

This charm makes a humanoid creature regard you as its trusted friend and ally (treat the target's attitude as friendly). If the creature is currently being threatened or attacked by you or your allies, however, it receives a +5 bonus on its saving throw.

The spell does not enable you to control the charmed person as if it were an automaton, but it perceives your words and actions in the most favorable way. You can try to give the subject orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn't ordinarily do. (Retries are not allowed.) An affected creature never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing. Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the charmed person breaks the spell. You must speak the person's language to communicate your commands, or else be good at pantomiming.

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Target or Area: One spellcaster, creature, or object; or 20-ft.-radius burst
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No

You can use dispel magic to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within an area, or to counter another spellcaster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic. Dispel magic can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells.

Note: The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the dispel magic can take effect.

You choose to use dispel magic in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a counterspell:
Targeted Dispel

One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature. The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the spell's caster level. If you succeed on a particular check, that spell is dispelled; if you fail, that spell remains in effect.

If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.

If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level. If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.

You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.
Area Dispel

When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot radius.

For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the spell with the highest caster level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell (which discharges the dispel magic spell so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The creature's magic items are not affected.

For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, you make dispel checks as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel.

For each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the dispel magic spell, you can make a dispel check to dispel the spell.

For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the dispel magic spell, you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.

If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning) is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel spells targeting the creature or object.

You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast.
Counterspell

When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, dispel magic may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.

The transmuted creatures move and act more quickly than normal. This extra speed has several effects.

When making a full attack action, a hasted creature may make one extra attack with any weapon he is holding. The attack is made using the creature's full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. (This effect is not cumulative with similar effects, such as that provided by a weapon of speed, nor does it actually grant an extra action, so you can't use it to cast a second spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round.)

A hasted creature gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves. Any condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose dodge bonuses.

All of the hasted creature's modes of movement (including land movement, burrow, climb, fly, and swim) increase by 30 feet, to a maximum of twice the subject's normal speed using that form of movement. This increase counts as an enhancement bonus, and it affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for increased speed.

Multiple haste effects don't stack. Haste dispels and counters slow.

Material Component
A shaving of licorice root.

Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Target or Area: One spellcaster, creature, or object; or 20-ft.-radius burst
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No

You can use dispel magic to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within an area, or to counter another spellcaster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic. Dispel magic can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells.

Note: The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the dispel magic can take effect.

You choose to use dispel magic in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a counterspell:
Targeted Dispel

One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +5) against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature. The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the spell's caster level. If you succeed on a particular check, that spell is dispelled; if you fail, that spell remains in effect.

If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.

If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level. If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.

You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.
Area Dispel

When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot radius.

For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the spell with the highest caster level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell (which discharges the dispel magic spell so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The creature's magic items are not affected.

For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, you make dispel checks as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel.

For each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the dispel magic spell, you can make a dispel check to dispel the spell.

For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the dispel magic spell, you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.

If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning) is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel spells targeting the creature or object.

You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast.
Counterspell

When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, dispel magic may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.

Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: Yes

A missile of magical energy darts forth from your fingertip and strikes its target, dealing 1d4+1 points of force damage.

The missile strikes unerringly, even if the target is in melee combat or has less than total cover or total concealment. Specific parts of a creature can't be singled out. Inanimate objects are not damaged by the spell.

For every two caster levels beyond 1st, you gain an additional missile—two at 3rd level, three at 5th, four at 7th, and the maximum of five missiles at 9th level or higher. If you shoot multiple missiles, you can have them strike a single creature or several creatures. A single missile can strike only one creature. You must designate targets before you check for spell resistance or roll damage.

Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)
Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

The subject's outline appears blurred, shifting and wavering. This distortion grants the subject concealment (20% miss chance).

A see invisibility spell does not counteract the blur effect, but a true seeing spell does.

Opponents that cannot see the subject ignore the spell's effect (though fighting an unseen opponent carries penalties of its own).

Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: 10 min./level

By means of read magic, you can decipher magical inscriptions on objects - books, scrolls, weapons, and the like - that would otherwise be unintelligible. This deciphering does not normally invoke the magic contained in the writing, although it may do so in the case of a cursed scroll. Furthermore, once the spell is cast and you have read the magical inscription, you are thereafter able to read that particular writing without recourse to the use of read magic. You can read at the rate of one page (250 words) per minute. The spell allows you to identify a glyph of warding with a DC 13 Spellcraft check, a greater glyph of warding with a DC 16 Spellcraft check, or any symbol spell with a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + spell level).

Read magic can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

Area: Cone-shaped emanation
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 min./level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No

You detect magical auras. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.

1st Round
Presence or absence of magical auras.

2nd Round
Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura.

3rd Round
The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + half caster level for a nonspell effect.)

Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.

Outsiders and elementals are not magical in themselves, but if they are summoned, the conjuration spell registers.

Each round, you can turn to detect magic in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

Detect magic can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

Range: Touch
Target: Creature touched
Duration: 10 min./level
Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)
Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

The subject can climb and travel on vertical surfaces or even traverse ceilings as well as a spider does. The affected creature must have its hands free to climb in this manner. The subject gains a climb speed of 20 feet; furthermore, it need not make Climb checks to traverse a vertical or horizontal surface (even upside down). A spider climbing creature retains its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus to their attacks against it. It cannot, however, use the run action while climbing.

Material Component
A drop of bitumen and a live spider, both of which must be eaten by the subject.

Duration: 1 round/level
Saving Throw: Will negates (see text)
Spell Resistance: Yes

This spell renders as many as three undead creatures immobile. A nonintelligent undead creature gets no saving throw; an intelligent undead creature does. If the spell is successful, it renders the undead creature immobile for the duration of the spell (similar to the effect of hold person on a living creature). The effect is broken if the halted creatures are attacked or take damage.

Material Component
A pinch of sulfur and powdered garlic.

Duration: 1 min./level
Saving Throw: Fortitude partial; see text
Spell Resistance: Yes

A black ray projects from your pointing finger. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target.

The subject is immediately exhausted for the spell's duration. A successful Fortitude save means the creature is only fatigued.

A character that is already fatigued instead becomes exhausted.

This spell has no effect on a creature that is already exhausted. Unlike normal exhaustion or fatigue, the effect ends as soon as the spell's duration expires.

Material Component
A drop of sweat.

Duration: 10 minutes/level

You can understand the spoken words of creatures or read otherwise incomprehensible written messages.  In either case, you must touch the creature or the writing.  The ability to read does not necessarily impart insight into the material, merely its literal meaning.  The spell allows you to understand or read an unknown language, not speak or write it.

[ALFA-specific: all languages spoken by the target creature will be understood by the caster for the duration of the spell.  The spell does not impart knowledge of what languages are being translated, and a new casting of Comprehend Languages supercedes a prior one, only one creature may be comprehended at a time.  In order to understand the words of a second creature (speaking the same language or a different one), a new spell must be cast.]

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Effect: Webs in a 20-ft.-radius spread
Duration: 10 min./level (D)
Saving Throw: Reflex negates; see text
Spell Resistance: No

Web creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands. These strands trap those caught in them. The strands are similar to spider webs but far larger and tougher. These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points or else the web collapses upon itself and disappears. Creatures caught within a web become entangled among the gluey fibers. Attacking a creature in a web won't cause you to become entangled.

Anyone in the effect's area when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save. If this save succeeds, the creature is entangled, but not prevented from moving, though moving is more difficult than normal for being entangled (see below). If the save fails, the creature is entangled and can't move from its space, but can break loose by spending 1 round and making a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check. Once loose (either by making the initial Reflex save or a later Strength check or Escape Artist check), a creature remains entangled, but may move through the web very slowly. Each round devoted to moving allows the creature to make a new Strength check or Escape Artist check. The creature moves 5 feet for each full 5 points by which the check result exceeds 10.

If you have at least 5 feet of web between you and an opponent, it provides cover. If you have at least 20 feet of web between you, it provides total cover.

The strands of a web spell are flammable. A magic flaming sword can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs. Any fire can set the webs alight and burn away 5 square feet in 1 round. All creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of fire damage from the flames.

Web can be made permanent with a permanency spell. A permanent web that is damaged (but not destroyed) regrows in 10 minutes.

Material Component
A bit of spider web.

Target: You and touched objects or other touched willing creatures
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: None and Will negates (object)
Spell Resistance: No and Yes (object)

NOTE: This spell lets you teleport as described. Due to engine limitations, contact a DM if you need to teleport somewhere you are otherwise unable to.

You instantly transfer yourself from your current location to any other spot within range. You always arrive at exactly the spot desired—whether by simply visualizing the area or by stating direction. After using this spell, you can't take any other actions until your next turn. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you.

If you arrive in a place that is already occupied by a solid body, you and each creature traveling with you take 1d6 points of damage and are shunted to a random open space on a suitable surface within 100 feet of the intended location.

If there is no free space within 100 feet, you and each creature traveling with you take an additional 2d6 points of damage and are shunted to a free space within 1,000 feet. If there is no free space within 1,000 feet, you and each creature travelling with you take an additional 4d6 points of damage and the spell simply fails.

A pale glow surrounds and outlines the subjects. Outlined subjects shed light as candles. Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally provided by darkness (though a 2nd-level or higher magical darkness effect functions normally), blur, displacement, invisibility, or similar effects. The light is too dim to have any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures vulnerable to light. The faerie fire can be blue, green, or violet, according to your choice at the time of casting. The faerie fire does not cause any harm to the objects or creatures thus outlined.

Range: Touch
Target:	Your touched staff
Duration: 1 hour/level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No

You change a specially prepared quarterstaff into a Huge treantlike creature, about 24 feet tall. When you plant 
the end of the staff in the ground and speak a special command to conclude the casting of the spell, your staff 
turns into a creature that looks and fights just like a treant. The staff-treant defends you and obeys any spoken 
commands. However, it is by no means a true treant; it cannot converse with actual treants or control trees. If 
the staff-treant is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it crumbles to powder and the staff is destroyed. 
Otherwise, the staff returns to its normal form when the spell duration expires (or when the spell is dismissed), 
and it can be used as the focus for another casting of the spell. The staff-treant is always at full strength 
when created, despite any wounds it may have incurred the last time it appeared.
Focus

The quarterstaff, which must be specially prepared. The staff must be a sound limb cut from an ash, oak, or yew, 
then cured, shaped, carved, and polished (a process requiring twenty-eight days).

(( DMs:
A staff used for this spell must have the local integer "CHANGESTAFF_TAG" set to 1. To do this, add the variable to the staff in the toolset, or use the consol command "dm_setvarint CHANGESTAFF_TAG 1" and then click on the staff. ))

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

This spell instantly transports you to a designated destination, which may be as distant as 100 miles per caster level. Interplanar travel is not possible. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent (see below) per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. As with all spells where the range is personal and the target is you, you need not make a saving throw, nor is spell resistance applicable to you. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and spell resistance.

You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible. To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the Teleport table. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.

Familiarity:
"Very familiar" is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home. "Studied carefully" is a place you know well, either because you can currently see it, you've been there often, or you have used other means (such as scrying) to study the place for at least one hour. "Seen casually" is a place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. "Viewed once" is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic.

"False destination" is a place that does not truly exist or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.

On Target:
You appear where you want to be.

Off Target:
You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10

Level: Brd 1, Sor/Wiz 1, Trickery 1
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: 10 min./level (D)

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

You make yourself—including clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment—look different. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller, thin, fat, or in between. You cannot change your body type. Otherwise, the extent of the apparent change is up to you. You could add or obscure a minor feature or look like an entirely different person.

The spell does not provide the abilities or mannerisms of the chosen form, nor does it alter the perceived tactile (touch) or audible (sound) properties of you or your equipment.

If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on the Disguise check.

A creature that interacts with the glamer gets a Will save to recognize it as an illusion.

<1096><16778312>:Divination (Scrying)
Level: Brd 3, Clr 5, Drd 4, Sor/Wiz 4
Components: V, S, M/DF, F
Casting Time: 1 hour
Range: See text
Effect: Magical sensor
Duration: 1 min./level
Saving Throw: Will negates
Spell Resistance: Yes

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

You can see and hear some creature, which may be at any distance. If the subject succeeds on a Will save, the scrying attempt simply fails. The difficulty of the save depends on how well you know the subject and what sort of physical connection (if any) you have to that creature. Furthermore, if the subject is on another plane, it gets a +5 bonus on its Will save.

Knowledge | Will Save Modifier
None* | +10
Secondhand (you have heard of the subject) | +5
Firsthand (you have met the subject) | +0
Familiar (you know the subject well) | -5

* You must have some sort of connection to a creature you have no knowledge of.

Connection | Will Save Modifier
Likeness or picture | -2
Possession or garment | -4
Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, etc. | -10

If the save fails, you can see and hear the subject and the subject's immediate surroundings (approximately 10 feet in all directions of the subject). If the subject moves, the sensor follows at a speed of up to 150 feet.

As with all divination (scrying) spells, the sensor has your full visual acuity, including any magical effects. In addition, the following spells have a 5% chance per caster level of operating through the sensor: detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law, detect magic, and message.

If the save succeeds, you can't attempt to scry on that subject again for at least 24 hours.

<i>Arcane Material Component</i>
The eye of a hawk, an eagle, or a roc, plus nitric acid, copper, and zinc.

<i>Wizard, Sorcerer, or Bard Focus</i>
A mirror of finely wrought and highly polished silver costing not less than 1,000 gp. The mirror must be at least 2 feet by 4 feet.

<i>Cleric Focus</i>
A holy water font costing not less than 100 gp.

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

This spell functions like scrying, except as noted above. Additionally, all of the following spells function reliably through the sensor: detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law, detect magic, message, read magic, and tongues.

Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

You immediately become aware of any attempt to observe you by means of a divination (scrying) spell or effect. The spell's area radiates from you and moves as you move. You know the location of every magical sensor within the spell's area.

If the scrying attempt originates within the area, you also know its location; otherwise, you and the scrier immediately make opposed caster level checks (1d20 + caster level). If you at least match the scrier's result, you get a visual image of the scrier and an accurate sense of his or her direction and distance from you.

<i>Material Component</i>
A small piece of mirror and a miniature brass hearing trumpet.

Conjuration (Teleportation)
Level: Sor/Wiz 7, Travel 7

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

This spell functions like teleport, except that there is no range limit and there is no chance you arrive off target. In addition, you need not have seen the destination, but in that case you must have at least a reliable description of the place to which you are teleporting. If you attempt to teleport with insufficient information (or with misleading information), you disappear and simply reappear in your original location. Interplanar travel is not possible.
<1103><16778319>:Word of Recall
<1104><16778320>:Conjuration (Teleportation)
Level: Clr 6, Drd 8
Components: V
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Unlimited
Target: You and touched objects or other willing creatures
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: None or Will negates (harmless, object)
Spell Resistance: No or Yes (harmless, object)

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

Word of recall teleports you instantly back to your sanctuary when the word is uttered. You must designate the sanctuary when you prepare the spell, and it must be a very familiar place. The actual point of arrival is a designated area no larger than 10 feet by 10 feet. You can be transported any distance within a plane but cannot travel between planes. You can transport, in addition to yourself, any objects you carry, as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. Exceeding this limit causes the spell to fail.

An unwilling creature can't be teleported by word of recall. Likewise, a creature's Will save (or spell resistance) prevents items in its possession from being teleported. Unattended, nonmagical objects receive no saving throw.

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

You determine whether a creature, object, or area has been poisoned or is poisonous. You can determine the exact type of poison with a DC 20 Wisdom check. A character with the Craft (alchemy) skill may try a DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check if the Wisdom check fails, or may try the Craft (alchemy) check prior to the Wisdom check.

The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

Presence or absence of magical auras.

2nd Round
Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura.

3rd Round
The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + half caster level for a nonspell effect.)

Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.

Level: Brd 0, Sor/Wiz 0
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Effect: Up to four lights, all within a 10-ft.-radius area
Duration: 1 minute (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

Depending on the version selected, you create up to four lights that resemble lanterns or torches (and cast that amount of light), or up to four glowing spheres of light (which look like will-o'-wisps), or one faintly glowing, vaguely humanoid shape. The dancing lights must stay within a 10-foot-radius area in relation to each other but otherwise move as you desire (no concentration required): forward or back, up or down, straight or turning corners, or the like. The lights can move up to 100 feet per round. A light winks out if the distance between you and it exceeds the spell's range.

Dancing lights can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

Level: Brd 0, Sor/Wiz 0

Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Effect: Illusory sounds
Duration: 1 round/level (D)
Saving Throw: Will disbelief (if interacted with)
Spell Resistance: No

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

Ghost sound allows you to create a volume of sound that rises, recedes, approaches, or remains at a fixed place. You choose what type of sound ghost sound creates when casting it and cannot thereafter change the sound's basic character.

The volume of sound created depends on your level. You can produce as much noise as four normal humans per caster level (maximum twenty humans). Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be created. The noise a ghost sound spell produces can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise from sixteen humans, while a roaring dire tiger is equal to the noise from twenty humans.

Ghost sound can enhance the effectiveness of a silent image spell.

Ghost sound can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

Target: One nonmagical, unattended object weighing up to 5 lb.
Duration: Concentration
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

You point your finger at an object and can lift it and move it at will from a distance. As a move action, you can propel the object as far as 15 feet in any direction, though the spell ends if the distance between you and the object ever exceeds the spell's range.

Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: 10 ft.
Target: One object of up to 1 lb.
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless, object)
Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless, object)

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

Mending repairs small breaks or tears in objects (but not warps, such as might be caused by a warp wood spell). It will weld broken metallic objects such as a ring, a chain link, a medallion, or a slender dagger, providing but one break exists.

Ceramic or wooden objects with multiple breaks can be invisibly rejoined to be as strong as new. A hole in a leather sack or a wineskin is completely healed over by mending. The spell can repair a magic item, but the item's magical abilities are not restored. The spell cannot mend broken magic rods, staffs, or wands, nor does it affect creatures (including constructs). 
<1119><16778335>:Message
<1120><16778336>:Transmutation [Language-Dependent]

Targets: One creature/level
Duration: 10 min./level
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

You can whisper messages and receive whispered replies with little chance of being overheard. You point your finger at each creature you want to receive the message. When you whisper, the whispered message is audible to all targeted creatures within range. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal (or a thin sheet of lead), or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks the spell. The message does not have to travel in a straight line. It can circumvent a barrier if there is an open path between you and the subject, and the path's entire length lies within the spell's range. The creatures that receive the message can whisper a reply that you hear. The spell transmits sound, not meaning. It doesn't transcend language barriers.

Note: To speak a message, you must mouth the words and whisper, possibly allowing observers the opportunity to read your lips.

A short piece of copper wire.

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Target: Object weighing up to 30 lb. or portal that can be opened or closed
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Will negates (object)
Spell Resistance: Yes (object)

You can open or close (your choice) a door, chest, box, window, bag, pouch, bottle, barrel, or other container. If anything resists this activity (such as a bar on a door or a lock on a chest), the spell fails. In addition, the spell can only open and close things weighing 30 pounds or less. Thus, doors, chests, and similar objects sized for enormous creatures may be beyond this spell's ability to affect.

<i>Focus</i>
A brass key.

Universal
Level: Sor/Wiz 0

Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: 0 ft.
Effect: One personal rune or mark, all of which must fit within 1 sq. ft.
Duration: Permanent
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

This spell allows you to inscribe your personal rune or mark, which can consist of no more than six characters. The writing can be visible or invisible. An arcane mark spell enables you to etch the rune upon any substance without harm to the material upon which it is placed. If an invisible mark is made, a detect magic spell causes it to glow and be visible, though not necessarily understandable.

See invisibility, true seeing, a gem of seeing, or a robe of eyes likewise allows the user to see an invisible arcane mark. A read magic spell reveals the words, if any. The mark cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by the caster or by an erase spell.

If an arcane mark is placed on a living being, normal wear gradually causes the effect to fade in about a month.

Arcane mark must be cast on an object prior to casting instant summons on the same object (see that spell description for details).

Saving Throw: See text
Spell Resistance: No

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

Prestidigitations are minor tricks that novice spellcasters use for practice. Once cast, a prestidigitation spell enables you to perform simple magical effects for 1 hour. The effects are minor and have severe limitations. A prestidigitation can slowly lift 1 pound of material. It can color, clean, or soil items in a 1-foot cube each round. It can chill, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material. It cannot deal damage or affect the concentration of spellcasters. Prestidigitation can create small objects, but they look crude and artificial. The materials created by a prestidigitation spell are extremely fragile, and they cannot be used as tools, weapons, or spell components. Finally, a prestidigitation lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects. Any actual change to an object (beyond just moving, cleaning, or soiling it) persists only 1 hour.

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

This spell generates wholesome, drinkable water, just like clean rain water. Water can be created in an area as small as will actually contain the liquid, or in an area three times as large—possibly creating a downpour or filling many small receptacles.

Note: Conjuration spells can't create substances or objects within a creature. Water weighs about 8 pounds per gallon. One cubic foot of water contains roughly 8 gallons and weighs about 60 pounds.

You instantly know the direction of north from your current position. The spell is effective in any environment in which "north" exists, but it may not work in extraplanar settings. Your knowledge of north is correct at the moment of casting, but you can get lost again within moments if you don't find some external reference point to help you keep track of direction.

This spell makes spoiled, rotten, poisonous, or otherwise contaminated food and water pure and suitable for eating and drinking. This spell does not prevent subsequent natural decay or spoilage. Unholy water and similar food and drink of significance is spoiled by purify food and drink, but the spell has no effect on creatures of any type nor upon magic potions.

Note: Water weighs about 8 pounds per gallon. One cubic foot of water contains roughly 8 gallons and weighs about 60 pounds.

This spell summons one handheld musical instrument of your choice. This instrument appears in your hands or at your feet (your choice). The instrument is typical for its type.

You use material from the Plane of Shadow to shape quasi-real illusions of one or more creatures, objects, or forces. Shadow conjuration can mimic any sorcerer or wizard conjuration (summoning) or conjuration (creation) spell of 3rd level or lower.

Shadow conjurations are actually one-fifth (20%) as strong as the real things, though creatures who believe the shadow conjurations to be real are affected by them at full strength.

Any creature that interacts with the conjured object, force, or creature can make a Will save to recognize its true nature.

Spells that deal damage have normal effects unless the affected creature succeeds on a Will save. Each disbelieving creature takes only one-fifth (20%) damage from the attack. If the disbelieved attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is only 20% likely to occur. Regardless of the result of the save to disbelieve, an affected creature is also allowed any save that the spell being simulated allows, but the save DC is set according to shadow conjuration

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

You contact a particular creature with which you are familiar and send a short message of twenty-five words or less to the subject. The subject recognizes you if it knows you. It can answer in like manner immediately. A creature with an Intelligence score as low as 1 can understand the sending, though the subject's ability to react is limited as normal by its Intelligence score. Even if the sending is received, the subject is not obligated to act upon it in any manner.

If the creature in question is not on the same plane of existence as you are, there is a 5% chance that the sending does not arrive. (Local conditions on other planes may worsen this chance considerably.)

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 round per level (D)
Saving Throw: See text
Spell Resistance: No

You can tell if an area contains a magic portal. If you study an area for 1 round, you know the sizes and locations of any portals in the area. Once you find a portal, you can study it. (If you find more than one portal, you can only study one at a time.)

Each round you study a portal, you can discover one property of the portal, in this order: any key or command word needed to activate the portal, any special circumstances governing the portal's use (such as specific times when the portal can be activated), whether the portal is one-way or two-way, any of the usual properties listed in the Building a Portal section earlier in this chapter (in the FRCS), and finally a glimpse of the area where the portal leads. You can look at the area where the portal leads for 1 round. Analyze portal does not allow other divination spells to extend through the portal. For example, you cannot use detect magic or detect evil to study the area where the portal leads while viewing the area with analyze portal.

For each property, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against DC 17. If you fail, you can try again the next round. Analyze portal has only limited ability to reveal unusual properties of portals, as follows:

-Random Portals: The spell reveals only that the portal is random, and whether it can be activated now. It does not reveal when the portal starts or stops functioning.

-Variable portals: The spell reveals only that the portal is variable. If the caster studies the portal's destination, the spell reveals only the destination to which the portal is currently set.

-Creature-only portals: The spell reveals this property. If the caster studies the portal's destination, the spell reveals where the portal sends creatures. If it is the type of portal that sends creatures one place and their equipment another place, the spell does not reveal where the equipment goes.

-Malfunctioning portals: The spell reveals only that the portal is malfunctioning, not what sort of malfunction the portal produces.

Duration: 4d12 hours; see text
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

You change the weather in the local area. It takes 10 minutes to cast the spell and an additional 10 minutes for the effects to manifest. You can call forth weather appropriate to the climate and season of the area you are in.

You control the general tendencies of the weather, such as the direction and intensity of the wind. You cannot control specific applications of the weather—where lightning strikes, for example, or the exact path of a tornado. When you select a certain weather condition to occur, the weather assumes that condition 10 minutes later (changing gradually, not abruptly). The weather continues as you left it for the duration, or until you use a standard action to designate a new kind of weather (which fully manifests itself 10 minutes later). Contradictory conditions are not possible simultaneously.

Control weather can do away with atmospheric phenomena (naturally occurring or otherwise) as well as create them.

A druid casting this spell doubles the duration and affects a circle with a 3-mile radius.

Season | Possible Weather
Spring | Tornado, thunderstorm, sleet storm, or hot weather
Summer | Torrential rain, heat wave, or hailstorm
Autumn | Hot or cold weather, fog, or sleet
Winter | Frigid cold, blizzard, or thaw
Late winter | Hurricane-force winds or early spring (coastal area)

Type of Tree Transport Range
Oak, ash, yew 3,000 feet
Elm, linden 2,000 feet
Other deciduous 1,500 feet
Any coniferous 1,000 feet
All other trees 500 feet

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

You gain the ability to enter trees and move from inside one tree to inside another tree. The first tree you enter and all others you enter must be of the same kind, must be living, and must have girth at least equal to yours. By moving into an oak tree (for example), you instantly know the location of all other oak trees within transport range (see below) and may choose whether you want to pass into one or simply step back out of the tree you moved into. You may choose to pass to any tree of the appropriate kind within the transport range as shown on the following table.

You may move into a tree up to one time per caster level (passing from one tree to another counts only as moving into one tree). The spell lasts until the duration expires or you exit a tree. Each transport is a full-round action.

You can, at your option, remain within a tree without transporting yourself, but you are forced out when the spell ends. If the tree in which you are concealed is chopped down or burned, you are slain if you do not exit before the process is complete.

With this spell, you bring back a dead creature in another body, provided that its death occurred no more than one week before the casting of the spell and the subject's soul is free and willing to return. If the subject's soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw.

Since the dead creature is returning in a new body, all physical ills and afflictions are repaired. The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature's body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature's body at the time of death. The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes 1 hour to complete. When the body is ready, the subject is reincarnated.

A reincarnated creature recalls the majority of its former life and form. It retains any class abilities, feats, or skill ranks it formerly possessed. Its class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and hit points are unchanged. Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores depend partly on the new body. First eliminate the subject's racial adjustments (since it is no longer of his previous race) and then apply the adjustments found below to its remaining ability scores. The subject's level (or Hit Dice) is reduced by 1. If the subject was 1st level, its new Constitution score is reduced by 2. (If this reduction would put its Con at 0 or lower, it can't be reincarnated). This level/HD loss or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any means.

It's possible for the change in the subject's ability scores to make it difficult for it to pursue its previous character class. If this is the case, the subject is well advised to become a multiclass character.

For a humanoid creature, the new incarnation is determined using the following table. For nonhumanoid creatures, a similar table of creatures of the same type should be created.

A creature that has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can't be returned to life by this spell. Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can't be reincarnated. The spell cannot bring back a creature who has died of old age.

The reincarnated creature gains all abilities associated with its new form, including forms of movement and speeds, natural armor, natural attacks, extraordinary abilities, and the like, but it doesn't automatically speak the language of the new form.

A wish or a miracle spell can restore a reincarnated character to his or her original form.

You can comprehend and communicate with plants, including both normal plants and plant creatures. You are able to ask questions of and receive answers from plants. A regular plant's sense of its surroundings is limited, so it won't be able to give (or recognize) detailed descriptions of creatures or answer questions about events outside its immediate vicinity.

The spell doesn't make plant creatures any more friendly or cooperative than normal.

You don't so much cast a miracle as request one. You state what you would like to have happen and request that your deity (or the power you pray to for spells) intercede.

A miracle can do any of the following things.

- Duplicate any cleric spell of 8th level or lower (including spells to which you have access because of your domains).
- Duplicate any other spell of 7th level or lower.
- Undo the harmful effects of certain spells, such as feeblemind or insanity.
- Have any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects.

If the miracle has any of the above effects, casting it has no experience point cost.

Alternatively, a cleric can make a very powerful request. Casting such a miracle costs the cleric 5,000 XP because of the powerful divine energies involved. Examples of especially powerful miracles of this sort could include the following.

- Swinging the tide of a battle in your favor by raising fallen allies to continue fighting.
- Moving you and your allies, with all your and their gear, from one plane to another through planar barriers to a specific locale with no chance of error.
- Protecting a city from an earthquake, volcanic eruption, flood, or other major natural disaster.

In any event, a request that is out of line with the deity's (or alignment's) nature is refused.

A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal, but the save DCs are as for a 9th-level spell. When a miracle duplicates a spell that has an XP cost, you must pay that cost. When a miracle spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 100 gp, you must provide that component.

<i>XP Cost</i>
5,000 XP (for some uses of the miracle spell; see above).

You can understand the spoken words of creatures or read otherwise incomprehensible written messages. In either case, you must touch the creature or the writing. The ability to read does not necessarily impart insight into the material, merely its literal meaning. The spell enables you to understand or read an unknown language, not speak or write it.

Written material can be read at the rate of one page (250 words) per minute. Magical writing cannot be read, though the spell reveals that it is magical. This spell can be foiled by certain warding magic (such as the secret page and illusory script spells). It does not decipher codes or reveal messages concealed in otherwise normal text.

Comprehend languages can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

Tongues can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

Casting Time: 1 immediate action
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Duration: Until landing or 1 round/level
Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless) or Will negates (object)
Spell Resistance: Yes (object)

The affected creatures or objects fall slowly. Feather fall instantly changes the rate at which the targets fall to a mere 60 feet per round (equivalent to the end of a fall from a few feet), and the subjects take no damage upon landing while the spell is in effect. However, when the spell duration expires, a normal rate of falling resumes.

The spell affects one or more Medium or smaller creatures (including gear and carried objects up to each creature's maximum load) or objects, or the equivalent in larger creatures: A Large creature or object counts as two Medium creatures or objects, a Huge creature or object counts as two Large creatures or objects, and so forth.

You can cast this spell with an instant utterance, quickly enough to save yourself if you unexpectedly fall. Casting the spell is a immediate action, allowing you to cast this spell even when it isn't your turn.

This spell has no special effect on ranged weapons unless they are falling quite a distance. If the spell is cast on a falling item the object does half normal damage based on its weight, with no bonus for the height of the drop.

Feather fall works only upon free-falling objects. It does not affect a sword blow or a charging or flying creature.

This spell soothes and quiets animals, rendering them docile and harmless. Only ordinary animals (those with Intelligence scores of 1 or 2) can be affected by this spell. All the subjects must be of the same kind, and no two may be more than 30 feet apart. The maximum number of Hit Dice of animals you can affect is equal to 2d4 + caster level. A dire animal or an animal trained to attack or guard is allowed a saving throw; other animals are not.

The affected creatures remain where they are and do not attack or flee. They are not helpless and defend themselves normally if attacked. Any threat breaks the spell on the threatened creatures.

A green ray springs from your outstretched hand. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit the target. Any creature or object struck by the ray is covered with a shimmering emerald field that completely blocks extradimensional travel. Forms of movement barred by a dimensional anchor include astral projection, blink, dimension door, ethereal jaunt, etherealness, gate, maze, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, and similar spell-like or psionic abilities. The spell also prevents the use of a gate or teleportation circle for the duration of the spell.

A dimensional anchor does not interfere with the movement of creatures already in ethereal or astral form when the spell is cast, nor does it block extradimensional perception or attack forms. Also, dimensional anchor does not prevent summoned creatures from disappearing at the end of a summoning spell.

The food that this spell creates is simple fare of your choice—highly nourishing, if rather bland. Food so created decays and becomes inedible within 24 hours, although it can be kept fresh for another 24 hours by casting a purify food and drink spell on it. The water created by this spell is just like clean rain water, and it doesn't go bad as the food does.

Duration: 1 hour/level
Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless, object)
Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless, object)

The warded creature or object becomes difficult to detect by divination spells such as clairaudience/clairvoyance, locate object, and detect spells. Nondetection also prevents location by such magic items as crystal balls. If a divination is attempted against the warded creature or item, the caster of the divination must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the spellcaster who cast nondetection. If you cast nondetection on yourself or on an item currently in your possession, the DC is 15 + your caster level.

If cast on a creature, nondetection wards the creature's gear as well as the creature itself.

Material Component
A pinch of diamond dust worth 50 gp.

Duration: One day/level (D)
Saving Throw: None; see text
Spell Resistance: No

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

You alter an item's aura so that it registers to detect spells (and spells with similar capabilities) as though it were nonmagical, or a magic item of a kind you specify, or the subject of a spell you specify.

If the object bearing magic aura has identify cast on it or is similarly examined, the examiner recognizes that the aura is false and detects the object's actual qualities if he succeeds on a Will save. Otherwise, he believes the aura and no amount of testing reveals what the true magic is.

If the targeted item's own aura is exceptionally powerful (if it is an artifact, for instance), magic aura doesn't work.

Note: A magic weapon, shield, or suit of armor must be a masterwork item, so a sword of average make, for example, looks suspicious if it has a magical aura.
Focus

A small square of silk that must be passed over the object that receives the aura.

Level: Brd 3, Sor/Wiz 4
Components: V
Casting Time: 1 round
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Target: One living creature with 7 HD or less
Duration: One day/level or until discharged (D)
Saving Throw: Will negates
Spell Resistance: Yes

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

A lesser geas places a magical command on a creature to carry out some service or to refrain from some action or course of activity, as desired by you. The creature must have 7 or fewer Hit Dice and be able to understand you. While a geas cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of activity.

The geased creature must follow the given instructions until the geas is completed, no matter how long it takes.

If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his own actions the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level. A clever recipient can subvert some instructions:

If the subject is prevented from obeying the lesser geas for 24 hours, it takes a -2 penalty to each of its ability scores. Each day, another -2 penalty accumulates, up to a total of -8. No ability score can be reduced to less than 1 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the lesser geas.

A lesser geas (and all ability score penalties) can be ended by break enchantment, limited wish, remove curse, miracle, or wish. Dispel magic does not affect a lesser geas.

A geas places a magical command on a creature to carry out some service or to refrain from some action or course of activity, as desired by you. The creature must be able to understand you. While a geas cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of activity.

The geased creature must follow the given instructions until the geas is completed, no matter how long it takes. If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his own actions the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level. A clever recipient can subvert some instructions:

If the subject is prevented from obeying the lesser geas for 24 hours, the subject takes 3d6 points of damage each day it cannot follow the geas/quest. Additionally, each day it must make a Fortitude saving throw or become sickened. These effects end 24 hours after the creature attempts to resume the geas/quest.

A remove curse spell ends a geas/quest spell only if its caster level is at least two higher than your caster level. Break enchantment does not end a geas/quest, but limited wish, miracle, and wish do.

Bards, sorcerers, and wizards usually refer to this spell as geas, while clerics call the same spell quest.

Effect: Wall whose area is up to one 10-ft. square/level
Duration: 1 round /level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No

A wall of force spell creates an invisible wall of force. The wall cannot move, it is immune to damage of all kinds, and it is unaffected by most spells, including dispel magic. However, disintegrate immediately destroys it, as does a rod of cancellation, a sphere of annihilation, or a mage

Area: Barred cage (20-ft. cube) or windowless cell (10-ft. cube)
Duration: 2 hours/level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No

This powerful spell brings into being an immobile, invisible cubical prison composed of solid walls of force.

Creatures within the area are caught and contained unless they are too big to fit inside, in which case the spell automatically fails. Teleportation and other forms of astral travel provide a means of escape, but the force walls or bars extend into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.

Like a wall of force spell, a forcecage resists dispel magic, but it is vulnerable to a disintegrate spell, and it can be destroyed by a sphere of annihilation or a rod of cancellation.

Material Component
Ruby dust worth 1,500 gp, which is tossed into the air and disappears when you cast the spell.

Similar to augury but more powerful, a divination spell can provide you with a useful piece of advice in reply to a question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity that is to occur within one week. The advice can be as simple as a short phrase, or it might take the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen. If your party doesn't act on the information, the conditions may change so that the information is no longer useful. The base chance for a correct divination is 70% + 1% per caster level, to a maximum of 90%. If the dice roll fails, you know the spell failed, unless specific magic yielding false information is at work.

As with augury, multiple divinations about the same topic by the same caster use the same dice result as the first divination spell and yield the same answer each time.

<i>Material Component</i>
Incense and a sacrificial offering appropriate to your religion, together worth at least 25 gp. 
<1226><16778442>:Discern Location

Level: Clr 8, Knowledge 8, Sor/Wiz 8
Components: V, S, DF
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: Unlimited
Target: One creature or object
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

A discern location spell is among the most powerful means of locating creatures or objects. Nothing short of a mind blank spell or the direct intervention of a deity keeps you from learning the exact location of a single individual or object. Discern location circumvents normal means of protection from scrying or location. The spell reveals the name of the creature or object's location (place, name, business name, building name, or the like), community, county (or similar political division), country, continent, and the plane of existence where the target lies.

To find a creature with the spell, you must have seen the creature or have some item that once belonged to it. To find an object, you must have touched it at least once. 
<1228><16778444>:Augury
<1229><16778445>:Divination

Duration: Instantaneous

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

An augury can tell you whether a particular action will bring good or bad results for you in the immediate future.

The base chance for receiving a meaningful reply is 70% + 1% per caster level, to a maximum of 90%; this roll is made secretly. A question may be so straightforward that a successful result is automatic, or so vague as to have no chance of success. If the augury succeeds, you get one of four results:

- Weal (if the action will probably bring good results).
- Woe (for bad results).
- Weal and woe (for both).
- Nothing (for actions that don't have especially good or bad results).

If the spell fails, you get the "nothing" result. A cleric who gets the "nothing" result has no way to tell whether it was the consequence of a failed or successful augury.

The augury can see into the future only about half an hour, so anything that might happen after that does not affect the result. Thus, the result might not take into account the long-term consequences of a contemplated action. All auguries cast by the same person about the same topic use the same dice result as the first casting.

<i>Material Component</i>
Incense worth at least 25 gp.

<i>Focus</i>
A set of marked sticks, bones, or similar tokens of at least 25 gp value.

Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]
Level: Clr 2, Pal 2
Components: V, S, DF
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Area: 20-ft.-radius emanation
Duration: 1 min./level
Saving Throw: Will negates
Spell Resistance: Yes

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

Creatures within the emanation area (or those who enter it) can't speak any deliberate and intentional lies. Each potentially affected creature is allowed a save to avoid the effects when the spell is cast or when the creature first enters the emanation area. Affected creatures are aware of this enchantment. Therefore, they may avoid answering questions to which they would normally respond with a lie, or they may be evasive as long as they remain within the boundaries of the truth. Creatures who leave the area are free to speak as they choose.

Area: Circle, centered on you, with a radius of 400 ft. + 40 ft./level
Duration: 1 min./level
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

You sense the direction of a well-known or clearly visualized object. You can search for general items, in which case you locate the nearest one of its kind if more than one is within range. Attempting to find a certain item requires a specific and accurate mental image; if the image is not close enough to the actual object, the spell fails. You cannot specify a unique item unless you have observed that particular item firsthand (not through divination).

The spell is blocked by even a thin sheet of lead. Creatures cannot be found by this spell. Polymorph any object fools it.

Arcane Focus
A forked twig.

<1235><16778451>:Divination
Level: Brd 4, Sor/Wiz 4
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 10 min./level

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

This spell functions like locate object, except this spell locates a known or familiar creature.

You slowly turn and sense when you are facing in the direction of the creature to be located, provided it is within range. You also know in which direction the creature is moving, if any.

The spell can locate a creature of a specific kind or a specific creature known to you. It cannot find a creature of a certain type. To find a kind of creature, you must have seen such a creature up close (within 30 feet) at least once.

Running water blocks the spell. It cannot detect objects. It can be fooled by mislead, nondetection, and polymorph spells.

Material Component
A bit of fur from a bloodhound.

Duration: 1 min./level
Saving Throw: Will negates; see text
Spell Resistance: No

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

You grant the semblance of life and intellect to a corpse, allowing it to answer several questions that you put to it. You may ask one question per two caster levels. Unasked questions are wasted if the duration expires. The corpse's knowledge is limited to what the creature knew during life, including the languages it spoke (if any). Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive. If the creature's alignment was different from yours, the corpse gets a Will save to resist the spell as if it were alive.

If the corpse has been subject to speak with dead within the past week, the new spell fails. You can cast this spell on a corpse that has been deceased for any amount of time, but the body must be mostly intact to be able to respond. A damaged corpse may be able to give partial answers or partially correct answers, but it must at least have a mouth in order to speak at all.

This spell does not let you actually speak to the person (whose soul has departed). It instead draws on the imprinted knowledge stored in the corpse. The partially animated body retains the imprint of the soul that once inhabited it, and thus it can speak with all the knowledge that the creature had while alive. The corpse, however, cannot learn new information.

Indeed, it can't even remember being questioned.

This spell does not affect a corpse that has been turned into an undead creature. 
<1238><16778454>:Detect Thoughts
<1239><16778455>:Divination [Mind-Affecting]

Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: 60 ft.
Area: Cone-shaped emanation
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 min./level (D)
Saving Throw: Will negates; see text
Spell Resistance: No

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

You detect surface thoughts. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.

1st Round
Presence or absence of thoughts (from conscious creatures with Intelligence scores of 1 or higher).

2nd Round
Number of thinking minds and the Intelligence score of each. If the highest Intelligence is 26 or higher (and at least 10 points higher than your own Intelligence score), you are stunned for 1 round and the spell ends. This spell does not let you determine the location of the thinking minds if you can't see the creatures whose thoughts you are detecting.

3rd Round
Surface thoughts of any mind in the area. A target's Will save prevents you from reading its thoughts, and you must cast detect thoughts again to have another chance. Creatures of animal intelligence (Int 1 or 2) have simple, instinctual thoughts that you can pick up.

Each round, you can turn to detect thoughts in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

<i>Arcane Focus</i>
A copper piece. 
<1240><16778456>:Arcane Sight

Duration: 1 min./level (D)

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

This spell makes your eyes glow blue and allows you to see magical auras within 120 feet of you. The effect is similar to that of a detect magic spell, but arcane sight does not require concentration and discerns aura location and power more quickly.

You know the location and power of all magical auras within your sight. An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning level or an item's caster level, as noted in the description of the detect magic spell. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + one-half caster level for a nonspell effect.)

If you concentrate on a specific creature within 120 feet of you as a standard action, you can determine whether it has any spellcasting or spell-like abilities, whether these are arcane or divine (spell-like abilities register as arcane), and the strength of the most powerful spell or spell-like ability the creature currently has available for use.

Arcane sight can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

Duration: 10 min./level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

You forge a telepathic bond among yourself and a number of willing creatures, each of which must have an Intelligence score of 3 or higher. Each creature included in the link is linked to all the others. The creatures can communicate telepathically through the bond regardless of language. No special power or influence is established as a result of the bond. Once the bond is formed, it works over any distance (although not from one plane to another).

If desired, you may leave yourself out of the telepathic bond forged. This decision must be made at the time of casting.

Telepathic bond can be made permanent with a permanency spell, though it only bonds two creatures per casting of permanency.

Level: Destruction 7, Sor/Wiz 6
Components: V, S, DF
Casting Time: 1 action

Effect: Ray
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Fortitude partial
Spell Resistance: Yes

A thin, green ray springs from the character's pointing finger, causing the creature or object it strikes to glow and vanish, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. The character must make a successful ranged touch attack to hit. Up to a 10-foot cube of nonliving matter is affected, so the spell disintegrates only part of any very large object or structure targeted. The ray affects even magical matter or energy of a magical nature but not a globe of invulnerability or an antimagic field. A creature or object that makes a successful Fortitude save is only partially affected. It takes 5d6 points of damage instead of disintegrating. Only the first creature or object struck can be affected (that is, the ray affects only one target per casting).

The character gains knowledge of the surrounding territory. The character instantly gains knowledge of up to three facts from among the following subjects: the ground or terrain, plants, minerals, bodies of water, people, general animal population, presence of woodland creatures, presence of powerful unnatural creatures, or the general state of the natural setting. 

In outdoor settings, the spell operates in a radius of one mile per caster level. In natural underground settings the range is limited to 100 feet per caster level. The spell does not function where nature has been replaced by construction or settlement.

The subject can climb and travel on vertical surfaces or even traverse ceilings as well as a spider does. The affected creature must have bare hands and feet to climb in this manner. The subject climbs at half its speed. A creature with a Strength score of at least 20 +1 per caster level can pull the subject off a wall.

Magic fang gives all natural weapons of the subject a +1 enhancement bonus to attack and damage rolls per four caster levels.

((The ALFA implementation affects either all creature weapon slots, or the arms slot, of a creature in that order.  There must be at least one valid object in place, whether a creature's claw or bite attack (for most creatures or animal companions), or a set of gloves in the case of the arms slot (for most humanoids or PCs).  If casting this spell on a PC, ensure that some gloves are being worn.))

Saving Throw: 	Will disbelief (if interacted with)
Spell Resistance: 	Yes

You tap energy from the Plane of Shadow to cast a quasi-real, illusory version of the following spells: Magic Missile, Darkness, Lightning Bolt, Wall of Fire, or Ice Storm.

Spells that deal damage have normal effects unless an affected creature succeeds on a Will save. Each disbelieving creature takes only one-fifth damage from the attack. If the disbelieved attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is one-fifth as strong (if applicable) or only 20% likely to occur. If recognized as a shadow evocation, a damaging spell deals only one-fifth (20%) damage. Regardless of the result of the save to disbelieve, an affected creature is also allowed any save (or spell resistance) that the spell being simulated allows, but the save DC is set according to shadow evocation's level (5th) rather than the spell's normal level.

Nondamaging effects have normal effects except against those who disbelieve them. Against disbelievers, they have no effect.

Objects automatically succeed on their Will saves against this spell.

You use material from the Plane of Shadow to shape quasi-real illusions of one or more creatures, objects, or forces. Shadow conjuration can mimic the following spells: Grease, Lesser Orb of Lightning, Flame Arrow, Stinking Cloud, or Mestil's Acid Breath.

Shadow conjurations are actually one-fifth (20%) as strong as the real things, though creatures who believe the shadow conjurations to be real are affected by them at full strength.

Any creature that interacts with the conjured object, force, or creature can make a Will save to recognize its true nature.

In addition, any effect created by shadow conjuration allows spell resistance, even if the spell it is simulating does not. Shadow objects or substances have normal effects except against those who disbelieve them.

Against disbelievers, they are 20% likely to work.

Range: 	Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Target/Effect: 	You/one illusory double
Duration: 	1 round/level (D) and concentration + 3 rounds; see text
Saving Throw: 	None or Will disbelief (if interacted with); see text
Spell Resistance: 	No

You become invisible (as greater invisibility, a glamer), and at the same time, an illusory double of you (as major image, a figment) appears. You are then free to go elsewhere while your double moves away. The double appears within range but thereafter moves as you direct it (which requires concentration beginning on the first round after the casting). You can make the figment appear superimposed perfectly over your own body so that observers don't notice an image appearing and you turning invisible. You and the figment can then move in different directions. The double moves at your speed and can talk and gesture as if it were real, but it cannot attack or cast spells, though it can pretend to do so.

The illusory double lasts as long as you concentrate upon it, plus 3 additional rounds. After you cease concentration, the illusory double continues to carry out the same activity until the duration expires. The greater invisibility lasts for 1 round per level, regardless of concentration.

Level: Sor/Wiz 5
Components: V
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: Concentration

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

You send your mind to another plane of existence (an Elemental Plane or some plane farther removed) in order to receive advice and information from powers there. (See the accompanying table for possible consequences and results of the attempt.) The powers reply in a language you understand, but they resent such contact and give only brief answers to your questions. (All questions are answered with "yes," "no," "maybe," "never," "irrelevant," or some other one-word answer.)

You must concentrate on maintaining the spell (a standard action) in order to ask questions at the rate of one per round. A question is answered by the power during the same round. For every two caster levels, you may ask one question.

Contact with minds far removed from your home plane increases the probability that you will incur a decrease to Intelligence and Charisma, but the chance of the power knowing the answer, as well as the probability of the entity answering correctly, are likewise increased by moving to distant planes.

Once the Outer Planes are reached, the power of the deity contacted determines the effects. (Random results obtained from the table are subject to the personalities of individual deities.)

On rare occasions, this divination may be blocked by an act of certain deities or forces.

d% is rolled for the result shown on the table:
Plane Contacted | Avoid Int/Cha Decrease[1] | True Answer[2] | Don't Know[3] | Lie[4] | Random Answer[5]
Elemental Plane | DC 7/1 week | 01-34 | 35-62 | 63-83 | 84-100
(appropriate) | (DC 7/1 week) | (01-68) | (69-75) | (76-98) | (99-100)
Positive/Negative Energy Plane | DC 8/1 week | 01-39 | 40-65 | 66-86 | 87-100
Astral Plane | DC 9/1 week | 01-44 | 45-67 | 68-88 | 89-100
Outer Plane, demideity | DC 10/2 weeks | 01-49 | 50-70 | 71-91 | 92-100
Outer Plane, lesser deity | DC 12/3 weeks 01-60 | 61-75 | 76-95 | 96-100
Outer Plane, intermediate deity | DC 14/4 weeks | 01-73 | 74-81 | 82-98 | 99-100
Outer Plane, greater deity | DC 16/5 weeks | 01-88 | 89-90 | 91-99 | 100

1. You must succeed on an Intelligence check against this DC to avoid a decrease in Intelligence and Charisma. If the check fails, your Intelligence and Charisma scores each fall to 8 for the stated duration, and you become unable to cast arcane spells. If you lose Intelligence and Charisma, the effect strikes as soon as the first question is asked, and no answer is received. (The entries in parentheses are for questions that pertain to the appropriate Elemental Plane.)
2. You get a true, one-word answer. Questions that cannot be answered in this way are answered randomly.
3. The entity tells you that it doesn't know.
4. The entity intentionally lies to you.
5. The entity tries to lie but doesn't know the answer, so it makes one up.

Duration: Instantaneous; see text
Saving Throw: Reflex partial
Spell Resistance: Yes

You rub the oil against the flint and murmur the ancient words, touching your target. It immediately smolders and then bursts into bright flames.

This spell makes a combustible object or a creature's combustible equipment burst into flame, even if damp.

If the target is a creature, the initial eruption of flame causes 1d8 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 10d8) with no saving throw. Further, the creature must make a DC 15 Reflex save or catch fire (DMG 303).

If the target is a combustible, unattended object, the initial eruption of flame deals fire damage to the object as noted above. The object catches fire and takes 1d6 points of fire damage each round until consumed or someone puts out the fire. ((Note: this does not currently function in ALFA))

Material Component: A drop of oil and a piece of flint.

Area: 20-ft.-radius emanation centered on a point in space
Duration: 2 hours/level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

Alarm sounds a mental or audible alarm each time a creature of Tiny or larger size enters the warded area or touches it. A creature that speaks the password (determined by you at the time of casting) does not set off the alarm. You decide at the time of casting whether the alarm will be mental or audible.
Mental Alarm

A mental alarm alerts you (and only you) so long as you remain within 1 mile of the warded area. You note a single mental "ping" that awakens you from normal sleep but does not otherwise disturb concentration. A silence spell has no effect on a mental alarm.
Audible Alarm

An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell, and anyone within 60 feet of the warded area can hear it clearly. Reduce the distance by 10 feet for each interposing closed door and by 20 feet for each substantial interposing wall.

In quiet conditions, the ringing can be heard faintly as far as 180 feet away. The sound lasts for 1 round. Creatures within a silence spell cannot hear the ringing.

Ethereal or astral creatures do not trigger the alarm.

Alarm can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

<i>Arcane Focus</i>
A tiny bell and a piece of very fine silver wire

Target: One Tiny animal
Duration: One day/level
Saving Throw: None; see text
Spell Resistance: Yes

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

You compel a Tiny animal to go to a spot you designate. The most common use for this spell is to get an animal to carry a message to your allies. The animal cannot be one tamed or trained by someone else, including such creatures as familiars and animal companions.

Using some type of food desirable to the animal as a lure, you call the animal to you. It advances and awaits your bidding. You can mentally impress on the animal a certain place well known to you or an obvious landmark. The directions must be simple, because the animal depends on your knowledge and can't find a destination on its own. You can attach some small item or note to the messenger. The animal then goes to the designated location and waits there until the duration of the spell expires, whereupon it resumes its normal activities.

During this period of waiting, the messenger allows others to approach it and remove any scroll or token it carries. The intended recipient gains no special ability to communicate with the animal or read any attached message (if it's written in a language he or she doesn't know, for example).

<i>Material Component</i>
A morsel of food the animal likes.

The subject becomes temporarily immune to poison. Any poison in its system or any poison to which it is exposed during the spell's duration does not affect the subject until the spell's duration has expired. Delay poison does not cure any damage that poison may have already done.

Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

You can detect a particular kind of animal or plant in a cone emanating out from you in whatever direction you face. You must think of a kind of animal or plant when using the spell, but you can change the animal or plant kind each round. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you search a particular area or focus on a specific kind of animal or plant.

<i>1st Round</i>
Presence or absence of that kind of animal or plant in the area.

<i>2nd Round</i>
Number of individuals of the specified kind in the area, and the condition of the healthiest specimen.

<i>3rd Round</i>
The condition (see below) and location of each individual present. If an animal or plant is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location.

Conditions
For purposes of this spell, the categories of condition are as follows:

<i>Normal</i>
Has at least 90% of full normal hit points, free of disease.

<i>Fair</i>
30% to 90% of full normal hit points remaining.

<i>Poor</i>
Less than 30% of full normal hit points remaining, afflicted with a disease, or suffering from a debilitating injury.

<i>Weak</i>
0 or fewer hit points remaining, afflicted with a disease in the terminal stage, or crippled.

If a creature falls into more than one category, the spell indicates the weaker of the two.

Each round you can turn to detect a kind of animal or plant in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

Duration: Concentration, up to 10 min./level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

You can detect simple pits, deadfalls, and snares as well as mechanical traps constructed of natural materials. The spell does not detect complex traps, including trapdoor traps.

Detect snares and pits does detect certain natural hazards—quicksand (a snare), a sinkhole (a pit), or unsafe walls of natural rock (a deadfall). However, it does not reveal other potentially dangerous conditions. The spell does not detect magic traps (except those that operate by pit, deadfall, or snaring; see the spell snare), nor mechanically complex ones, nor those that have been rendered safe or inactive.

The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area.

<i>1st Round</i>
Presence or absence of hazards.

<i>2nd Round</i>
Number of hazards and the location of each. If a hazard is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location.

<i>Each Additional Round</i>
The general type and trigger for one particular hazard closely examined by you.

Each round, you can turn to detect snares and pits in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

Animals cannot see, hear, or smell the warded creatures. Even extraordinary or supernatural sensory capabilities, such as blindsense, blindsight, scent, and tremorsense, cannot detect or locate warded creatures. Animals simply act as though the warded creatures are not there. If a warded character touches an animal or attacks any creature, even with a spell, the spell ends for all recipients.

Spell Resistance: Yes

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

An invisible vertical curtain of wind appears. It is 2 feet thick and of considerable strength. It is a roaring blast sufficient to blow away any bird smaller than an eagle, or tear papers and similar materials from unsuspecting hands. (A Reflex save allows a creature to maintain its grasp on an object.) Tiny and Small flying creatures cannot pass through the barrier. Loose materials and cloth garments fly upward when caught in a wind wall. Arrows and bolts are deflected upward and miss, while any other normal ranged weapon passing through the wall has a 30% miss chance. (A giant-thrown boulder, a siege engine projectile, and other massive ranged weapons are not affected.) Gases, most gaseous breath weapons, and creatures in gaseous form cannot pass through the wall (although it is no barrier to incorporeal creatures).

While the wall must be vertical, you can shape it in any continuous path along the ground that you like. It is possible to create cylindrical or square wind walls to enclose specific points.

Duration: 1 hour/level (D)

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

By means of this spell, you are able to assume the form of a Large living tree or shrub or a Large dead tree trunk with a small number of limbs. The closest inspection cannot reveal that the tree in question is actually a magically concealed creature. To all normal tests you are, in fact, a tree or shrub, although a detect magic spell reveals a faint transmutation on the tree. While in tree form, you can observe all that transpires around you just as if you were in your normal form, and your hit points and save bonuses remain unaffected. You gain a +10 natural armor bonus to AC but have an effective Dexterity score of 0 and a speed of 0 feet. You are immune to critical hits while in tree form. All clothing and gear carried or worn changes with you.

You can dismiss tree shape as a free action (instead of as a standard action).

(This bonus doesn't apply to other uses of the Bluff skill, such as feinting in combat, creating a diversion to hide, or communicating a hidden message via innuendo.)

If a magical effect is used against you that would detect your lies or force you to speak the truth the user of the effect must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 15 + your caster level to succeed. Failure means the effect does not detect your lies or force you to speak only the truth.

(It ignores the first 10 points of damage each time it takes damage from a weapon, though an adamantine weapon bypasses the reduction.) Once the spell has prevented a total of 10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 150 points), it is discharged.

Duration: 1 minute/ level

You gain intuitive insight into the workings of traps. You can use the Search skill to detect traps just as a rogue can. In addition, you gain an insight bonus equal to one-half your caster level on Search checks while the spell is in effect.

Note that find traps grants no ability to disable the traps you may find.

In addition, note that traps created before ACR v1.90 will be directly revealed at the casting of the spell.
<1306><16778522>:Silence
Illusion (Glamer)
Level: Brd 2, Clr 2
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
Area: 20-ft.-radius emanation centered on a creature, object, or point in space
Duration: 1 min./level (D)
Saving Throw: Will negates; see text or none (object)
Spell Resistance: Yes; see text or no (object)

Upon the casting of this spell, complete silence prevails in the affected area. All sound is stopped: Conversation is impossible, spells with verbal components cannot be cast, and no noise whatsoever issues from, enters, or passes through the area. The spell can be cast on a point in space, but the effect is stationary unless cast on a mobile object. The spell can be centered on a creature, and the effect then radiates from the creature and moves as it moves. An unwilling creature can attempt a Will save to negate the spell and can use spell resistance, if any. Items in a creature's possession or magic items that emit sound receive the benefits of saves and spell resistance, but unattended objects and points in space do not. This spell provides a defense against sonic or language-based attacks.
<1307><16778523>:Animate Rope
<1308><16778524>:<b>Animate Rope</b>
Transmutation
Level: Brd 1, Sor/Wiz 1
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Target: One ropelike object, length up to 50 ft. + 5 ft./level; see text
Duration: 1 round/level
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

You can animate a nonliving ropelike object. The maximum length assumes a rope with a 1-inch diameter.

Reduce the maximum length by 50% for every additional inch of thickness, and increase it by 50% for each reduction of the rope's diameter by half.

The possible commands are "coil" (form a neat, coiled stack), "coil and knot," "loop," "loop and knot," "tie and knot," and the opposites of all of the above ("uncoil," and so forth). You can give one command each round as a move action, as if directing an active spell.

The rope can enwrap only a creature or an object within 1 foot of it -- it does not snake outward -- so it must be thrown near the intended target. Doing so requires a successful ranged touch attack roll (range increment 10 feet). A typical 1-inch-diameter hempen rope has 2 hit points, AC 10, and requires a DC 23 Strength check to burst it. The rope does not deal damage, but it can be used as a trip line or to cause a single opponent that fails a Reflex saving throw to become entangled. A creature capable of spellcasting that is bound by this spell must make a DC 15 Concentration check to cast a spell. An entangled creature can slip free with a DC 20 Escape Artist check.

The rope itself and any knots tied in it are not magical.

This spell grants a +2 bonus on any Use Rope checks you make when using the transmuted rope.

The spell cannot animate objects carried or worn by a creature.

Area: Cone-shaped emanation
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 min./level (D)

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

You can detect secret doors, compartments, caches, and so forth. Only passages, doors, or openings that have been specifically constructed to escape detection are detected by this spell. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.

<i>1st Round</i>
Presence or absence of secret doors.

<i>2nd Round</i>
Number of secret doors and the location of each. If an aura is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location.

<i>Each Additional Round</i>
The mechanism or trigger for one particular secret portal closely examined by you. Each round, you can turn to detect secret doors in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

Target: One scroll or two pages
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: See text
Spell Resistance: No

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

Erase removes writings of either magical or mundane nature from a scroll or from one or two pages of paper, parchment, or similar surfaces. With this spell, you can remove explosive runes, a glyph of warding, a sepia snake sigil, or an arcane mark, but not illusory script or a symbol spell. Nonmagical writing is automatically erased if you touch it and no one else is holding it. Otherwise, the chance of erasing nonmagical writing is 90%.

Magic writing must be touched to be erased, and you also must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against DC 15. (A natural 1 or 2 is always a failure on this check.) If you fail to erase explosive runes, a glyph of warding, or a sepia snake sigil, you accidentally activate that writing instead.

Area: Several living creatures, no two of which may be more than 30 ft. apart
Duration: 2d4 rounds (D)
Saving Throw: Will negates
Spell Resistance: Yes

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

Your gestures and droning incantation fascinate nearby creatures, causing them to stop and stare blankly at you. In addition, you can use their rapt attention to make your suggestions and requests seem more plausible. Roll 2d4 to see how many total Hit Dice of creatures you affect. Creatures with fewer HD are affected before creatures with more HD. Only creatures that can see or hear you are affected, but they do not need to understand you to be fascinated.

If you use this spell in combat, each target gains a +2 bonus on its saving throw. If the spell affects only a single creature not in combat at the time, the saving throw has a penalty of -2.

While the subject is fascinated by this spell, it reacts as though it were two steps more friendly in attitude. This allows you to make a single request of the affected creature (provided you can communicate with it). The request must be brief and reasonable. Even after the spell ends, the creature retains its new attitude toward you, but only with respect to that particular request.

A creature that fails its saving throw does not remember that you enspelled it. 
<1315><16778531>:Magic Mouth
<1316><16778532>:<b>Magic Mouth</b>
Illusion (Glamer)
Level: Brd 1, Sor/Wiz 2
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Target: One creature or object
Duration: Permanent until discharged
Saving Throw: Will negates (object)
Spell Resistance: Yes (object)

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

This spell imbues the chosen object or creature with an enchanted mouth that suddenly appears and speaks its message the next time a specified event occurs. The message, which must be twenty-five or fewer words long, can be in any language known by you and can be delivered over a period of 10 minutes. The mouth cannot utter verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects. It does, however, move according to the words articulated; if it were placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue would move and appear to speak. Of course, magic mouth can be placed upon a tree, rock, or any other object or creature.

The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled according to your command as set in the spell. Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used. Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical darkness or invisibility does. Silent movement or magical silence defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises or to a specific noise or spoken word. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. A magic mouth cannot distinguish alignment, level, Hit Dice, or class except by external garb.

The range limit of a trigger is 15 feet per caster level, so a 6th-level caster can command a magic mouth to respond to triggers as far as 90 feet away. Regardless of range, the mouth can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance.

Magic mouth can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

This spell hides an object from location by divination (scrying) effects, such as the scrying spell or a crystal ball.

You transmute as many as three pebbles, which can be no larger than sling bullets, so that they strike with great force when thrown or slung. If hurled, they have a range increment of 20 feet. If slung, treat them as sling bullets (range increment 50 feet). The spell gives them a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. The user of the stones makes a normal ranged attack. Each stone that hits deals 1d6+1 points of damage (including the spell's enhancement bonus), or 2d6+2 points against undead.

A misty vapor arises around you. It is stationary once created. The vapor obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target).

A moderate wind (11+ mph), such as from a gust of wind spell, disperses the fog in 4 rounds. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round. A fireball, flame strike, or similar spell burns away the fog in the explosive or fiery spell's area. A wall of fire burns away the fog in the area into which it deals damage.

This spell does not function underwater.

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

Flames as bright as a torch appear in your open hand. The flames harm neither you nor your equipment.

In addition to providing illumination, the flames can be hurled or used to touch enemies. You can strike an opponent with a melee touch attack, dealing fire damage equal to 1d6 +1 point per caster level (maximum +5). Alternatively, you can hurl the flames up to 120 feet as a thrown weapon. When doing so, you attack with a ranged touch attack (with no range penalty) and deal the same damage as with the melee attack. No sooner do you hurl the flames than a new set appears in your hand. Each attack you make reduces the remaining duration by 1 minute. If an attack reduces the remaining duration to 0 minutes or less, the spell ends after the attack resolves.

You assume the form of a creature of the same type as your normal form. The new form must be within one size category of your normal size. The maximum HD of an assumed form is equal to your caster level, to a maximum of 5 HD at 5th level. You can change into a member of your own kind or even into yourself.

You retain your own ability scores. Your class and level, hit points, alignment, base attack bonus, and base save bonuses all remain the same. You retain all supernatural and spell-like special attacks and qualities of your normal form, except for those requiring a body part that the new form does not have (such as a mouth for a breath weapon or eyes for a gaze attack).

You keep all extraordinary special attacks and qualities derived from class levels, but you lose any from your normal form that are not derived from class levels.

If the new form is capable of speech, you can communicate normally. You retain any spellcasting ability you had in your original form, but the new form must be able to speak intelligibly (that is, speak a language) to use verbal components and must have limbs capable of fine manipulation to use somatic or material components.

You acquire the physical qualities of the new form while retaining your own mind. Physical qualities include natural size, mundane movement capabilities (such as burrowing, climbing, walking, swimming, and flight with wings, to a maximum speed of 120 feet for flying or 60 feet for nonflying movement), natural armor bonus, natural weapons (such as claws, bite, and so on), racial skill bonuses, racial bonus feats, and any gross physical qualities (presence or absence of wings, number of extremities, and so forth). A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal.

You do not gain any extraordinary special attacks or special qualities not noted above under physical qualities, such as darkvision, low-light vision, blindsense, blindsight, fast healing, regeneration, scent, and so forth.

You do not gain any supernatural special attacks, special qualities, or spell-like abilities of the new form. Your creature type and subtype (if any) remain the same regardless of your new form. You cannot take the form of any creature with a template, even if that template doesn't change the creature type or subtype.

You can freely designate the new form's minor physical qualities (such as hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of that kind. The new form's significant physical qualities (such as height, weight, and gender) are also under your control, but they must fall within the norms for the new form's kind. You are effectively disguised as an average member of the new form's race. If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on your Disguise check.

When the change occurs, your equipment, if any, either remains worn or held by the new form (if it is capable of wearing or holding the item), or melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional. When you revert to your true form, any objects previously melded into the new form reappear in the same location on your body they previously occupied and are once again functional. Any new items you wore in the assumed form and can't wear in your normal form fall off and land at your feet; any that you could wear in either form or carry in a body part common to both forms at the time of reversion are still held in the same way. Any part of the body or piece of equipment that is separated from the whole reverts to its true form.

A successful Will save reduces damage to half and negates the sickened effect. The effects cannot be negated by remove disease or heal, but remove curse is effective.

The spell deals only half damage to creatures who are neither evil nor good, and they are not sickened. Such a creature can reduce the damage in half again (down to one-quarter) with a successful Will save.

You detoxify any sort of venom in the creature or object touched. A poisoned creature suffers no additional effects from the poison, and any temporary effects are ended, but the spell does not reverse instantaneous effects, such as hit point damage, temporary ability damage, or effects that don't go away on their own.

The creature is immune to any poison it is exposed to during the duration of the spell. Unlike with delay poison, such effects aren't postponed until after the duration —the creature need not make any saves against poison effects applied to it during the length of the spell.

This spell ensures privacy. Anyone looking into the area from outside sees only a dark, foggy mass. Darkvision cannot penetrate it. No sounds, no matter how loud, can escape the area, so nobody can eavesdrop from outside. Those inside can see out normally.

Divination (scrying) spells cannot perceive anything within the area, and those within are immune to <i>detect thoughts</i>. The ward prevents speech between those inside and those outside (because it blocks sound), but it does not prevent other communication, such as a <i>sending</i> or <i>message</i> spell, or telepathic communication, such as that between a wizard and her familiar.

The spell does not prevent creatures or objects from moving into and out of the area.

<b>Level</b>: Brd 1, Sor/Wiz 1
<b>Components</b>: V, S, M
<b>Casting Time</b>: 1 round
<b>Range</b>: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

A sleep spell causes a magical slumber to come upon 4 Hit Dice of creatures. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first.

Among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell's point of origin are affected first. Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted.

Sleeping creatures are helpless. Slapping or wounding awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not. Awakening a creature is a standard action (an application of the aid another action).

Sleep does not target unconscious creatures, constructs, or undead creatures.

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

You can sense the presence of a specific alignment. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.

<i>1st Round</i>
Presence or absence of the alignment.

<i>2nd Round</i>
Number of the alignment's auras (creatures, objects, or spells) in the area and the power of the most potent aura present.

If you are of the opposite alignment, and the strongest aura's power is overwhelming, and the HD or level of the aura's source is at least twice your character level, you are stunned for 1 round and the spell ends.

<i>3rd Round</i>
The power and location of each aura. If an aura is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location.

<i>Aura Power</i>
An aura's power depends on the type of creature or object that you're detecting and its HD, caster level, or (in the case of a cleric) class level. If an aura falls into more than one strength category, the spell indicates the stronger of the two.

Creature/Object | Faint | Moderate | Strong | Overwhelming
Evil creature* (HD) | 10 or lower | 11-25 | 26-50 | 51 or higher
Undead (HD) | 2 or lower | 3-8 | 9-20 | 21 or higher
Evil outsider (HD) | 1 or lower | 2-4 | 5-10 | 11 or higher
Cleric of an evil deity% (class levels) | 1 | 2-4 | 5-10 | 11 or higher
Evil magic item or spell (caster level) | 2nd or lower | 3rd-8th | 9th-20th | 21st or higher
    *Except for undead and outsiders, which have their own entries on the table.
    %Some characters who are not clerics may radiate an aura of equivalent power. The class description will indicate whether this applies.

<i>Lingering Aura</i>
An evil aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a creature or magic item). If detect evil is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power.

Animals, traps, poisons, and other potential perils are not evil, and as such this spell does not detect them.

Each round, you can turn to detect evil in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

Original Strength | Duration of Lingering Aura
Faint | 1d6 rounds
Moderate | 1d6 minutes
Strong | 1d6×10 minutes
Overwhelming | 1d6 days

<b>Effect:</b> 3-ft.-diameter disk of force
<b>Duration:</b> 1 hour/level
<b>Saving Throw:</b> None
<b>Spell Resistance:</b> No

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

You create a slightly concave, circular plane of force that follows you about and carries loads for you. The disk is 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch deep at its center. It can hold 100 pounds of weight per caster level. (If used to transport a liquid, its capacity is 2 gallons.) The disk floats approximately 3 feet above the ground at all times and remains level. It floats along horizontally within spell range and will accompany you at a rate of no more than your normal speed each round. If not otherwise directed, it maintains a constant interval of 5 feet between itself and you. The disk winks out of existence when the spell duration expires. The disk also winks out if you move beyond range or try to take the disk more than 3 feet away from the surface beneath it. When the disk winks out, whatever it was supporting falls to the surface beneath it.

<i>Material Component</i>
A drop of mercury.

You preserve the remains of a dead creature so that they do not decay. Doing so effectively extends the time limit on raising that creature from the dead (see raise dead). Days spent under the influence of this spell don't count against the time limit. Additionally, this spell makes transporting a fallen comrade more pleasant.

The spell also works on severed body parts and the like.

<i>Arcane Material Component</i>
A pinch of salt, and a copper piece for each eye the corpse has (or had).
<1364><16778580>:Levitate
<1365><16778581>:Transmutation
<b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 2
<b>Components:</b> V, S, F
<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action
<b>Range:</b> Personal or close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
<b>Target:</b> You or one willing creature or one object (total weight up to 100 lb./level)
<b>Duration:</b> 1 min./level (D)
<b>Saving Throw:</b> None
<b>Spell Resistance:</b> No

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

Levitate allows you to move yourself, another creature, or an object up and down as you wish. A creature must be willing to be levitated, and an object must be unattended or possessed by a willing creature. You can mentally direct the recipient to move up or down as much as 20 feet each round; doing so is a move action. You cannot move the recipient horizontally, but the recipient could clamber along the face of a cliff, for example, or push against a ceiling to move laterally (generally at half its base land speed).

A levitating creature that attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds itself increasingly unstable; the first attack has a -1 penalty on attack rolls, the second -2, and so on, to a maximum penalty of -5. A full round spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at -1.

<i>Focus</i>
Either a small leather loop or a piece of golden wire bent into a cup shape with a long shank on one end.

<b>Target:</b> You or one willing creature or one object (total weight up to 100 lb./level)
<b>Duration:</b> 1 min./level (D)
<b>Saving Throw:</b> None
<b>Spell Resistance:</b> No

When this spell is cast upon a piece of rope from 5 to 30 feet long, one end of the rope rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular to the ground, as if affixed at the upper end. The upper end is, in fact, fastened to an extradimensional space that is outside the multiverse of extradimensional spaces ("planes"). Creatures in the extradimensional space are hidden, beyond the reach of spells (including divinations), unless those spells work across planes. The space holds as many as eight creatures (of any size). Creatures in the space can pull the rope up into the space, making the rope "disappear." In that case, the rope counts as one of the eight creatures that can fit in the space. The rope can support up to 16,000 pounds. A weight greater than that can pull the rope free.

Spells cannot be cast across the extradimensional interface, nor can area effects cross it. Those in the extradimensional space can see out of it as if a 3-foot by 5-foot window were centered on the rope. The window is present on the Material Plane, but it's invisible, and even creatures that can see the window can't see through it. Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell ends. The rope can be climbed by only one person at a time. The rope trick spell enables climbers to reach a normal place if they do not climb all the way to the extradimensional space.

<i>Note:</i> It is hazardous to create an extradimensional space within an existing extradimensional space or to take an extradimensional space into an existing one.

<i>Material Component</i>
Powdered corn extract and a twisted loop of parchment.

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

A cloud of golden particles covers everyone and everything in the area, causing creatures to become blinded and visibly outlining invisible things for the duration of the spell. All within the area are covered by the dust, which cannot be removed and continues to sparkle until it fades.

Any creature covered by the dust takes a -40 penalty on Hide checks.

<i>Material Component</i>
Ground mica.

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

When you need to keep track of comrades who may get separated, status allows you to mentally monitor their relative positions and general condition. You are aware of direction and distance to the creatures and any conditions affecting them: unharmed, wounded, disabled, staggered, unconscious, dying, nauseated, panicked, stunned, poisoned, diseased, confused, or the like. Once the spell has been cast upon the subjects, the distance between them and the caster does not affect the spell as long as they are on the same plane of existence. If a subject leaves the plane, or if it dies, the spell ceases to function for it.

This spell blesses an area with positive energy. Each Charisma check made to turn undead within this area gains a +3 sacred bonus. Every undead creature entering a consecrated area suffers minor disruption, giving it a -1 penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saves. Undead cannot be created within or summoned into a consecrated area.

If the consecrated area contains an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture dedicated to your deity, pantheon, or aligned higher power, the modifiers given above are doubled (+6 sacred bonus on turning checks, -2 penalties for undead in the area). You cannot consecrate an area with a similar fixture of a deity other than your own patron.

If the area does contain an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture of a deity, pantheon, or higher power other than your patron, the consecrate spell instead curses the area, cutting off its connection with the associated deity or power. This secondary function, if used, does not also grant the bonuses and penalties relating to undead, as given above.

Consecrate counters and dispels desecrate.

<i>Material Component</i>
A vial of holy water and 25 gp worth (5 pounds) of silver dust, all of which must be sprinkled around the area.

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

This spell imbues an area with negative energy. Each Charisma check made to turn undead within this area takes a -3 profane penalty, and every undead creature entering a desecrated area gains a +1 profane bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws. An undead creature created within or summoned into such an area gains +1 hit points per HD.

If the desecrated area contains an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture dedicated to your deity or aligned higher power, the modifiers given above are doubled (-6 profane penalty on turning checks, +2 profane bonus and +2 hit points per HD for undead in the area).

Furthermore, anyone who casts animate dead within this area may create as many as double the normal amount of undead (that is, 4 HD per caster level rather than 2 HD per caster level).

If the area contains an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture of a deity, pantheon, or higher power other than your patron, the desecrate spell instead curses the area, cutting off its connection with the associated deity or power. This secondary function, if used, does not also grant the bonuses and penalties relating to undead, as given above.

<b>Level:</b> Brd 2, Sor/Wiz 2
<b>Components:</b> V, S

<b>Range:</b> 1 mile/level
<b>Area:</b> 10-ft.-radius spread
<b>Duration:</b> No more than 1 hour/level or until discharged (destination is reached)
<b>Saving Throw:</b> None
<b>Spell Resistance:</b> No

NOTE: This spell has no direct in-game effect, and must be roleplayed with a DM.

You send a message or sound on the wind to a designated spot. The whispering wind travels to a specific location within range that is familiar to you, provided that it can find a way to the location. A whispering wind is as gentle and unnoticed as a zephyr until it reaches the location. It then delivers its whisper-quiet message or other sound. Note that the message is delivered regardless of whether anyone is present to hear it. The wind then dissipates.

You can prepare the spell to bear a message of no more than twenty-five words, cause the spell to deliver other sounds for 1 round, or merely have the whispering wind seem to be a faint stirring of the air. You can likewise cause the whispering wind to move as slowly as 1 mile per hour or as quickly as 1 mile per 10 minutes.

When the spell reaches its objective, it swirls and remains in place until the message is delivered. As with magic mouth, whispering wind cannot speak verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects.

Thay is known to Faerûn as the land of evil Red Wizards. While the Wizards are the elite nobility of the land, the government consists of tharchions picked by the eight most powerful of the Red Wizards who are known as zulkirs. All Thayan children are screened for magical ability and those showing potential are placed into rigorous training. Sorcery is despised in Thay for its lack of discipline. Geographically Thay is hot, dry and windy. Spells are carefully implemented to maintain good weather for crops. Slavery is abundant in Thay and most slaves are treated extremely badly. Free Thayans are a small but increasing class of careful folk who remain polite and restrained, with strong constitution and hidden emotions. Thay lies North of the Alambar Sea, South of Rashemen, East of Thesk and West of the Endless Waste.

A land of farmers and merchants, the trade way that runs through Thesk allows the Theskians to interact with a variety of cultures. As a result, Thesk is one of the more tolerant regions of Faerûn. Thesk is still rebuilding after devastating attacks by Tuigan nomads in the past. The orc population which lives peacefully here is a result of the Zhentarim's orc army left behind. Arcane magic is rare in Thesk, but the merchants are skilled appraisers due to their familiarity with high quality and uncommon goods. The city of Telfamm is independent from Thesk and from the outside ruled by a merchant prince. However the Shadowmaster thieves guild keeps the city firmly under control. Thesk lies South of Narfell, East of the Sea of Fallen Stars, West of Thay and North of Algarond.

Once a country that excelled in civilised arts, Unther fell abruptly into chaos after the death of the god Gilgeam at the hands of Tiamat. Slaves and commoners saw hope that their lives of misery would improve while clerics and nobles struggled to maintain order. Mulhorand saw an advantage and invaded the Southern region of Unther. Today Unther is on the edge of being lost to history under the control of Mulhorand and internal squabbles within the remaining free regions. It is a country divided into those who still desperately cling to the old ways and those who hope for a better life under the Mulhorandi pharaoh. Unther lies North of Eastern Shaar, West of Mulhorand and South East of Chessenta.

A cold, hard land formerly ruled by the terrible Witch-King, Vaasa is no longer a bastion of evil—but neither is it a place for those who aren't ready to defend themselves with sword and spell. Vaasa is a lonely land dotted with scratch farms and inhabited by evil humanoids and other monsters. What the land lacks in in hospitality though, it makes up for in untapped wealth as the mountains are rich in metals and gems. Miles of mountainside go unclaimed by any civilization, and many well-armed prospectors make the trip to Vaasa hoping to find gems the size of a man's fist - and survive long enough to sell them.

Orcs and dwarves vie for supremacy over the nearby mountains; Orc raids on the lowlands are rare, but troublesome enough to keep the human population concentrated along the coast. Intrigues between rival factions and a wealth of dwarven ruins beckon to adventurers eager to make names for themselves.

The Vilhon Reach is a large area just south of the Sea of Fallen Stars, rich with varied customs and beliefs. The area takes its name from the sea that surrounds it, an immense body of water with cities nestled against its borders. These cities and their warlike reputations are what most know about the Reach, but the Reach is as rich and diverse as any area of Faerûn. It has its petty politicians and powerful wizards, but the heart of the Reach is its people. Nature is a powerful force, much more powerful than that wielded by power-seeking wizards or the strength of arms of the most renowned adventuring company. Nature is more respected in the Reach than in other areas of Faerûn. This respect probably stems from the suffering from plagues and reinforced from time to time by the Emerald Enclave, a powerful force of druids that maintain balance in the area.

Along the southern shores of the Aglarondan peninsula lie the cities of the Wizards' Reach. Between the Sea of Fallen Stars and the Yuirwood stretches a broad, sunny plain more than 300 miles long and up to eighty miles wide. Unlike the northern coastal plain, the Wizards' Reach is low, marked by extensive tidal marshes and barrier islands, which makes east-west travel difficult.
The Wizards' Reach is not part of the kingdom of Aglarond and never has been. It is so named for the powerful magical empires that dominated this stretch of water for thousands of years. Its cities were founded by the people of ancient Unther (and Chessenta, which was subjugated by Unther at the time), and over the last ten centuries they have been Untheric colonies, independent, a loose league of their own, Chessentan conquests, independent again, and finally Thayan conquests, which is the current situation. In practice, the Red Wizards hold Escalant in strength, Laothkund loosely, and Delthuntle not at all.

Planetouched is a general word to describe someone who can trace his or her bloodline back to an outsider. This heritage may be celestial, fiendish, or elemental.

The effects of having a supernatural being in one's heritage last for many generations. Although not as dramatically altered as a half-celestial or a half-fiend, planetouched still retain some special qualities.

The most common varieties of planetouched are genasi, aasimar, and tieflings. The genasi have an elemental heritage, influenced by air, earth, fire, or water. Aasimar are humans with some trace of celestial blood in their veins, and tieflings have some fiendishness in their family tree.

Many PCs may consider full-blooded Orcs to be a monster race, and may treat a PC of this race accordingly.</i></b>

The orcs of the eastern lands are concentrated in the Moonsea and Endless Wastes today, with a much smaller number scattered through the various lands that lie between. A gray orc looks less bestial than their more savage northern kin, but is still obviously nonhuman. Grey orcs are more apt to wear "civilized" clothing than mountain orcs, though they typically follow a nomadic existence - dwelling in remote, desolate places and eking out a meager existence as best they can. The true power behind a tribe of gray orcs is not the chieftain, but the tribe's high priest, typically an adept or a cleric (often female), who has held the position for many years. The gray orcs are zealots, and the word of their tribal clerics is law.

Gray orcs are just as mean, savage, and barbaric as their northern cousins, but they lack the mountain orc's drive to conquer and enslave. Gray orcs are quite likely to react suddenly and irrationally to events, trusting their heart and instincts more readily than logic. When presented with an opportunity to attack a hated rival, a gray orc doesn't hesitate to attack even having been brutally defeated dozens of times before by the same enemy.

- <b>Light Sensitivity:</b> Gray orcs suffer a -1 penalty on attack rolls in sunlight or within the radius of a <i>daylight</i> spell.

- <b>Scent:</b> Can detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell. This allows the user to track hidden and invisible targets when using the Track ability.

- <b> Favored Class:</b> Cleric. Although gray orcs are comfortable with the savage life of the barbarian, they tend to be more calm and collected than northern orcs, focusing their rage and hatred inward. This allows them to excel as clerics of the warlike orc deities.

- <b>Level Adjustment +1:</b> Gray orcs are slightly more powerful and gain levels more slowly than other, more common races. It will take more experience for a gray orc to reach level 2 than it would for normal races, for example.

Hidden in the depths of the Underdark live the svirfneblin, or deep gnomes. Reclusive, suspicious, and resentful of intrusion into their cavern homes, the deep gnomes share little of the humor or openness of their surface cousins. The deep gnomes may be the world's stealthiest and most elusive folk.

The favored soul follows the path of the cleric but is able to channel divine power with surprising ease. She is able to perform the same tasks as her fellow divine spellcasters but with virtually no study. Favored souls cast their spells naturally, as much through force of personality as through study. Though this gives them extraordinary divine abilities no normal person could ever match, they see their gift as a call to action, and so in some ways may lag behind their more studious colleagues.

<color=Gold>Class Features:</color>

- <b>Hit Die:</b> d8

- <b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> Medium.

- <b>High Saves:</b> All.

- <b>Weapon Proficiencies:</b> Simple weapons and deity's favored weapon.

- <b>Armor Proficiencies:</b>  Light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).

- <b>Skill Points:</b> 2 + Int modifier per level, x4 at first level.

- <b>Class Skills:</b> Concentration, Craft Alchemy, Craft Armor, Craft Weapon, Diplomacy, Heal, Lore, Parry, and Spellcraft.

- <b>Spells:</b> A favored soul casts divine spells which are drawn from the cleric spell list. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time the way a cleric must. To cast a spell, a favored soul must have a Charisma score of 10 + the spell's level (Cha 10 for 0-level spells, Cha 11 for 1st-level spells, and so forth). The Difficulty Class for  a saving throw against a favored soul's spell is 10 + the spell's level + the favored soul's Wisdom modifier. Unlike a cleric, a favored soul's selection of spells is limited, but at 4th level, and at every even-numbered favored soul level after that, the favored soul may swap a spell she already knows for another spell of the same level. In effect, the favored soul "loses" the old spell in exchange for the new one.

- <b>Deity's Weapon Proficiency:</b> Favored souls gain a weapon proficiency feat that allows them to use their deity's favored weapon. (For example, favored souls of Kelemvor will gain the Exotic Weapon Proficiency feat, enabling them to use a bastard sword.)

- <b>Deity's Weapon Focus:</b> At 3rd level, a favored soul gains the Weapon Focus feat with her deity's favored weapon.

- <b>Energy Resistance:</b> At 5th level, a favored soul chooses an energy type and gains resistance 10 against that type. At 10th level and 15th level, the character gains resistance 10 against another energy type of her choosing.

- <b>Deity's Weapon Specialization:</b> At 12th level, a favored soul gains the Weapon Specialization feat with her deity's favored weapon.

- <b>Haste:</b> At 17th level, a favored soul gains the ability to cast <i>haste</i> three times per day.

- <b>Damage Reduction:</b> At 20th level, a favored soul gains damage reduction. She may choose between damage reduction 10/silver or damage reduction 10/cold iron.

<3184><16780400>:Crafting Project
<3185><16780401>:Craft
<3186><16780402>:This feat represents a PC working on some crafting project and should be targetted at the crafted item. It is usable once per rest as long as the PC is in an area which always allows resting (such as a house, inn room, etc). It cannot be used out in the wild or in a dungeon.

Magic items which require spell to be used in their creation must have those spells cast on them before the item can be worked on.

Potions always take only use (day) to brew. All other magic items are progressed at a rate of 1,000 gp of base cost per day. The PC must pay 1/25th of this cost in XP (to a maximum of 40XP per day).

DMs can use this feat and target an item in order to turn that item into a crafting project which can then be completed by PCs. Targeting an existing craft project turns the project back into a regular, usable item, destroying any progress made.
<3187><16780403>:Forge Ring
<3188><16780404>:(Please Note this Feat Requires DM assistance to use)

Prerequisite
Caster level 12th. 

Benefit
You can create any ring whose prerequisites you meet. Crafting a ring takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. To craft a ring, you must spend 1/25 of its base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of its base price. 

You can also mend a broken ring if it is one that you could make. Doing so costs half the XP, half the raw materials, and half the time it would take to forge that ring in the first place. 

Some magic rings incur extra costs in material components or XP, as noted in their descriptions. You must pay such a cost to forge such a ring or to mend a broken one. 

<3189><16780405>:Craft Rod
<3190><16780406>:(Please Note this Feat Requires DM assistance to use)

Prerequisite
Caster level 9th. 

Benefit
You can create any rod whose prerequisites you meet. Crafting a rod takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. To craft a rod, you must spend 1/25 of its base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of its base price. 

Some rods incur extra costs in material components or XP, as noted in their descriptions. These costs are in addition to those derived from the rod's base price. 

<3191><16780407>:Craft Staff
<3192><16780408>:(Please Note this Feat Requires DM assistance to use)

Prerequisite

Some staffs incur extra costs in material components or XP, as noted in their descriptions. These costs are in addition to those derived from the staff's base price. 

<3193><16780409>:Inscribe Rune (cleric)
<3194><16780410>:(Please Note this Feat Requires DM assistance to use)

Prerequisite
Intelligence 13+, Divine Caster level 3+, Appropriate craft skill*

Benefit: You can cast any divine spell you have prepared as a rune.  The caster must have prepared the spell to be scribed and must provide any material component or focuses the spell requires.  If casting the spell would reduce the caster's XP total, he pays the cost on beginning the rune in addition to the XP cost for making the rune itself.  Likewise, material components are consumed when he begins writing, but focuses are not.

A single object of Medium-size or smaller can hold only one rune.  Larger objects may hold one rune per 25 square feet (an area 5 feet square) of surface area.  Runes cannot be placed on creatures.  The rune has a market price of the spell level x caster level x 100 gp (a 0-level spell counts as 1/2 level).  You must spend 1/25th of its market price in XP and use up raw materials costing half this market price.  A rune's market value equals its base price.

*Appropriate craft skills are required to scribe runes on weapons (Craft: Weaponsmithing), bows (Craft: Bowmaking), and armor (Craft: Armorsmithing).
<3195><16780411>:(Please Note this Feat Requires DM assistance to use)

Prerequisite: Caster level 3rd.

Benefit: You may create any wonderous magical item whose prerequisites you meet.  These include a wide variety of item types, including amulets, gloves, bracers, cloaks, belts, helms, and boots.

Enchanting a wonderous item takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its price.  To enchant a wonderous item, you must spend 1/25th of the item's price in XP and use up raw materials costing half of the price.  You can also mend a broken wonderous item if it is one that you could make.  Doing so costs half the XP, half the raw materials, and half the time it would take to craft the item in the first place.

Crafting ingredients can vary widely - gems, creature parts, gold, gear, and trade goods can be included. Gear - such as travelling cloaks or leather boots - can be found at any merchant, while gems are carried in more exclusive stores. Creature parts can be found in the stores of bounty collectors, or dropped off the corpse of the creature in question. More exotic ingredients must be found through adventuring.

Also note: access to facilities, recipes, instructions, or special components may be required for magical crafting; please refer to the DM staff of the server on which the crafting is meant to occur in order to clarify current guidelines.

Use: Special (via DM assistance)

Prerequisite: Caster level 5th.

Benefit: You can create any magic weapon, armor, or shield whose prerequisites you meet. Enchanting a weapon, suit of armor, or shield takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its price.

The weapon, armor, or shield to be enhanced must be a masterwork item that you provide.  Its cost is not included in the above cost.  You can also mend a broken magic weapon, suit of armor, or shield if it is one that you could make.

<3223><16780439>:At 11th level and as a spell-like ability, a spirit shaman gains the ability to call back the spirit of a dead creature before the spirit of the deceased has completely left the body. Once per day, she can reconnect a spirit to its body, restoring life to a recently deceased creature. The ability must be used within 12 seconds of the victim's death. This ability functions like raise dead, except that the raised creature receives no level loss, no Constitution loss, and no loss of spells. The creature is only restored to –1 hit points (but is stabilized).

<5000><16782216>:Arcane Archer
<5001><16782217>:<color=Gold><b>Arcane Archer</b></color>

<color=Red>(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)</color>

Master of the elven warbands, the arcane archer is a warrior skilled in using magic to supplement her combat prowess. Beyond the woods, arcane archers gain renown throughout entire kingdoms for their supernatural accuracy with a bow and their ability to imbue their arrows with magic. In a group, they can strike fear into an entire enemy army. Fighters, rangers, paladins, and barbarians become arcane archers to add a little magic to their combat abilities. Conversely, wizards and sorcerers may take this prestige class to add combat capabilities to their repertoire. Monks, clerics, druids, rogues, and bards rarely become arcane archers.

<color=Gold>Requirements:</color>

<b>Race:</b> Elf or half-elf.

<b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> +6

<b>Feats:</b> Point Blank Shot, Weapon Focus (longbow or shortbow).

<b>Spellcasting: </b>Ability to cast 1st-level arcane spells.

<color=Gold>Class Features:</color>

- <b>Hit Die:</b> d8

- <b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> High.

- <b>High Saves:</b> Fortitude and Reflex.

- <b>Weapon Proficiencies:</b> Simple and martial weapons.

- <b>Armor Proficiencies:</b>  Light and medium armor and all shields  (excluding tower shields).

- <b>Skill Points:</b> 4 + Int modifier.

- <b>Class Skills:</b> The Arcane Archer's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Craft (Int), Hide (Dex), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Parry (Dex), Ride (Dex), Spot (Wis), Survival (Wis), and Use Rope (Dex).

- <b>Enhance Arrow:</b> Beginning at 1st level, the arcane archer imbues every arrow she fires with an enhancement bonus. This bonus is +1 at 1st level, +2 at 3rd level, +3 at 5th level, +4 at 7th level, and +5 at 9th level.

- <b>Imbue Arrow:</b> Three times per day, a 2nd-level arcane archer may choose to fire a special arrow imbued with the <i>fireball</i> spell. When the arrow hits its target, the <i>fireball</i> spell detonates from that point, inflicting damage as per the spell as though it were cast by a wizard of the arcane archer's class level.

- <b>Seeker Arrow:</b> Once per day, a 3rd-level arcane archer may fire an arrow that unerringly flies to its target, ignoring any and all cover, concealment, or other factors. When this ability is used, no attack roll is made; the target is automatically hit and takes damage as normal. At 6th level, this ability may be used twice per day.

- <b>Hail of Arrows:</b> At eighth level, the arcane archer gains the ability to perform this special ability, which automatically fires one arrow at every target within range as a full-round action. This ability may be used once per day.

- <b>Arrow of Death:</b> The pinnacle of the arcane archer's ability, at 10th level she may fire a special arrow imbued with powerful necromantic magic. If the target is hit, it must immediately make a Fortitude save (DC 20) or be slain. Even if it passes its saving throw, it takes damage from the arrow as normal. This ability may be used once per day.
<5002><16782218>:Arcane Scholar
<5003><16782219>:<color=Gold><b>Arcane Scholar of Candlekeep</b></color>

<color=Red>(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)</color>

Arcane scholars seek to raise the study of magic to the level of an academic discipline. Their interest is not in researching new spells or finding more specialized uses for their craft, but in understanding the fundamental processes of magic and the inner workings of the Weave, which is the fabric that underlies all magic.

The first arcane scholars emerged from the dusty libraries of Candlekeep, where they pored through the writings of a thousand long-dead mages, seeking the unifying principles that underlie all magic. But even the archives of Candlekeep have their limits, and not all practitioners of magic have the means or the desire to record their experiences with the Art. So arcane scholars dispersed into the wider world, observing and recording all the various expressions of magic they could find. Their tradition has gradually spread, and some mages who have never set foot in Candlekeep have adopted their disciplined and systematic approach to magic. 

By gaining a deeper understanding of magic, and by discerning its underlying principles, arcane scholars become specialists in metamagic. Their spells are more powerful, last longer, and can be cast more quickly than those of their peers. Arcane scholars have also become especially adept at explaining the workings of magic to ordinary folk. Those who travel with arcane scholars gain the benefit of their considerable knowledge and are better able to evade hostile magic.

Arcane scholars do not limit themselves to studying particular sorts of arcane magic. To truly understand the Art, they believe that one must understand all its expressions. Thus, all arcane casters are equally welcome to join their fellowship. Indeed, the insights of sorcerers and bards are particularly prized by arcane scholars, as such casters rarely have the patience to discuss the deeper workings of magic.

- <b>Bonus Metamagic Feats:</b> At 1st level, the arcane scholar gains the Maximize Spell feat. At 5th level, he gains the Quicken Spell feat.

<b><i>ALFA Note: The requirements on this class have been altered to more closely match PnP canon rules.</i></b>
<color=Red>(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)</color>

Arcane tricksters combine their knowledge of spells with a taste for intrigue, larceny, or just plain mischief. They are among the most adaptable of adventurers. Arcane spellcasting and the sneak attack ability are needed to qualify for this class, making it a natural choice for multiclass wizard/rogues or sorcerer/rogues. Assassins occasionally opt for this class, but usually only if they already have wizard or sorcerer levels.

<color=Gold>Requirements:</color>

<b>Alignment:</b> Any nonlawful.

<b>Skills:</b> Decipher Script 7 ranks, Disable Device 7 ranks, Escape Artist 7 ranks, Knowledge (arcana) 4 ranks.

<b>Spellcasting:</b> Ability to cast at least one arcane spell of 3rd level or higher.

<b>Special:</b> Sneak attack +2d6.

<color=Gold>Class Features:</color>

- <b>Hit Die:</b> d4

- <b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> Low.

- <b>High Saves:</b> Reflex and Will.

- <b>Weapon Proficiencies:</b> None.

- <b>Armor Proficiencies:</b> None.

- <b>Skill Points:</b> 4 + Int Modifier.

- <b>Class Skills:</b> The arcane trickster's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Appraise (Int), Balance (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Decipher Script (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Int), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Gather Information (Cha), Hide (Dex), Jump (Str), Knowledge (all skills taken individually) (Int), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Open Lock (Dex), Profession (Wis), Search (Int), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Speak Language (None), Spellcraft (Int), Spot (Wis), Swim (Str), Tumble (Dex), and Use Rope (Dex).

- <b>Spells per Day/Spells Known:</b> When a new arcane trickster level is gained, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as though he had gained a level in whatever arcane spellcasting class gave him access 3rd-level arcane spells. If the character has more than one applicable arcane spellcasting class, he must pick one to improve.

- <b>Pilfer Magic:</b> At 1st level, once per day, the arcane trickster can dispel a magical effect on a target and receive statistical bonuses from it.  The ability is a touch attack "lesser" dispel that affects the most powerful effect currently on the target. If successful, the effect vanishes from the target and the arcane trickster receives +2 bonus to attack rolls and all saving throws for the next ten rounds.  He can use this ability twice per day at 5th level and three times per day at 9th level.

- <b>Sneak Attack:</b> At every even-numbered level (2nd, 4,th, 6th, 8th, and 10th), the arcane trickster gains an additional +1d6 to his sneak attack damage. This ability stacks with sneak attack dice from other classes.

- <b>Impromptu Sneak Attack:</b> Once per day, a 3rd-level arcane trickster can use this ability to deny an enemy his Dexterity bonus to AC for one round, allowing the target to be sneak attacked. The arcane trickster gains an additional daily use of this ability at 7th level, and again at 9th level.
<5006><16782222>:Assassin
<5007><16782223>:<color=Gold><b>Assassin</b></color>

<b><i>ALFA Note: The requirements on this class have been altered to more closely match PnP canon rules.</i></b>
<color=Red>(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)</color>

The assassin is the master of dealing quick, lethal blows. Assassins often function as spies, informants, killers for hire, or agents of vengeance. Their training in anatomy, stealth, poison, and the dark arts allows them to carry out missions of death with shocking, terrifying precision. Most rogues, monks, and bards who choose this class become examples of the classic assassin skulking in the shadows with a blade carrying certain death. Fighters, ex-paladins, rangers, druids, and barbarians operate as warrior-assassins, with as much ability to kill in combat as from the shadows. Sorcerers, wizards, and clerics may be the most terrifying assassins of all, for with their spells they can infiltrate and slay with even greater impunity.

<color=Gold>Requirements:</color>

<b>Alignment:</b> Any evil.

<b>Skills:</b> Disguise 4 ranks, Hide 8 ranks, Move Silently 8 ranks.

<color=Gold>Class Features:</color>

- <b>Hit Die:</b> d6

- <b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> Medium.

- <b>High Saves:</b> Reflex.

- <b>Weapon Proficiencies:</b> Simple weapons.

- <b>Armor Proficiencies:</b>  Light armor.

- <b>Skill Points:</b> 4 + Int modifier.

- <b>Class Skills:</b> Balance (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Decipher Script (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Int), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Forgery (Int), Gather Information (Cha), Hide (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Jump (Str), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Open Lock (Dex), Parry (Dex), Search (Int), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spot (Wis), Swim (Str), Tumble (Dex), Use Magic Device (Cha), and Use Rope (Dex).

- <b>Death Attack:</b> At 1st level, the assassin can make a special sneak attack called a death attack. This ability adds to the rogue's sneak attack ability, adding an extra 1d6 points of damage. This bonus rises to +2d6 at 3rd level, +3d6 at 5th level, +4d6 at 7th level, and +5d6 at 9th level. If used against an opponent not already in combat, a successful Death Attack forces the victim to make a Fortitude save or become paralyzed.

- <b>Poison Resistance:</b> The assassin's expertise with deadly toxins gives him an unnatural resistance to poisons of all types. The assassin gains a +1 bonus on Fortitude saves against poison at 2nd level. This bonus increases to +2 at 4th level, +3 at 6th level, +4 at 8th level, and +5 at 10th level.

- <b>Uncanny Dodge:</b> At 2nd level, the assassin retains his Dexterity bonus to AC even when caught flat-footed.

- <b>Improved Uncanny Dodge:</b> At 5th level, the assassin can no longer be sneak attacked except by a rogue 4 or more levels higher than him.

- <b>Hide in Plain Sight:</b> At 8th level, the assassin may enter stealth mode even while being observed.

- <b>Spells:</b> At 2nd level, the assassin gains the ability to cast <i>ghostly visage</i> once per day. At 5th level, the assassin gains the ability to cast <i>darkness</i> once per day. At 7th level, the assassin gains the ability to cast <i>invisibility</i> once per day. At 9th level, the assassin gains the ability to cast <i>greater invisibility</i> once per day.
<5008><16782224>:Barbarian
<5009><16782225>:<color=Gold><b>Barbarian</b></color>

The barbarian is an excellent warrior. Where the fighter's skill comes from training and discipline, however, the barbarian draws upon a powerful primal rage. While in this berserk fury, he becomes stronger and tougher, better able to defeat his foes and withstand their attacks. These rages leave him winded, and he has the energy for only a few such spectacular displays per day, but those few rages are usually sufficient. He is at home in the wild, and he runs at great speed.

<color=Gold>Class Features:</color>

- <b>Alignment Restrictions:</b> Any nonlawful - barbarians are wild at heart.

- <b>Hit Die:</b> d12

- <b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> High.

- <b>High Saves:</b> Fortitude.

- <b>Weapon Proficiencies:</b> Simple and martial weapons.

- <b>Armor Proficiencies:</b>  Light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).

- <b>Skill Points:</b> 4 + Int modifier per level, x4 at first level.

- <b>Class Skills:</b> The barbarian's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Jump (Str), Listen (Wis), Parry (Dex), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).

- <b>Rage:</b> A barbarian can fly into a screaming blood frenzy a certain number of times per day. In a rage, a barbarian gains phenomenal strength and durability but becomes reckless and less able to defend himself. He temporarily gains a +4 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Constitution, and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but he takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. Rage lasts for 3 + Constitution bonus (including bonus from rage) rounds. After rage expires, the barbarian is tired and suffers -2 Strength, -2 Dexterity, and a -10% movement penalty for 5 rounds.

- <b>Fast Movement:</b> A barbarian has a 10% bonus to his movement rate.

- <b>Uncanny Dodge:</b> At 2nd level, a barbarian gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if he is caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. However, he still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.

- <b>Trap Sense:</b> Starting at 3rd level, a barbarian has an intuitive sense that alerts him to danger from traps, giving him a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses rise by +1 every three barbarian levels thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level).

- <b>Damage Reduction:</b> At 7th level, a barbarian gains the ability to shrug off some amount of injury from each blow or attack. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point.

- <b>Greater Rage:</b> At 11th level, a barbarian's bonuses to Strength and Constitution during his rage each increase to +6, and his morale bonus on Will saves increases to +3. The penalty to AC remains at -2.

- <b>Indomitable Will:</b> While in a rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist mind-affecting spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves he also receives during his rage.

- <b>Tireless Rage:</b> When a barbarian reaches 17th level, he no longer gets fatigued from using rage and can ignore the penalties to Strength, Dexterity, and movement.

- <b>Mighty Rage:</b> At 20th level, a barbarian's bonuses to Strength and Constitution during his rage each increase to +8, and his morale bonus on Will saves increases to +4. The penalty to AC remains at -2.
<5010><16782226>:Bard
<5011><16782227>:<color=Gold><b>Bard</b></color>

A bard brings forth magic from his soul, not from a book. He can cast only a small number of spells, but he can do so without selecting or preparing them in advance. His magic emphasizes charms and illusions over the more dramatic evocation spells that wizards and sorcerers often use. In addition to spells, a bard works magic with his music and poetry. He can encourage allies, hold his audiences rapt, and counter magical effects that rely on speech or sound. Bards have some of the skills that rogues have, although bards are not as focused on skill mastery as rogues are. A bard listens to stories as well as telling them, of course, so he has a vast knowledge of local events and noteworthy items.

<color=Gold>Class Features:</color>

- <b>Alignment Restrictions:</b> Any nonlawful - bards are wanderers, guided by whim and intuition.

- <b>Hit Die:</b> d6

- <b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> Medium.

- <b>High Saves:</b> Reflex and Will.

- <b>Weapon Proficiencies:</b> Simple weapons plus longsword, rapier, short sword, and shortbow.

- <b>Armor Proficiencies:</b>  Light armor and shields (except tower shields).

- <b>Skill Points:</b> 6 + Int modifier per level,  x4 at first level.

- <b>Class Skills:</b> The bard's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Appraise (Int), Balance (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Decipher Script (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Gather Information (Cha), Hide (Dex), Jump (Str), Knowledge (all skills, taken individually) (Int), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Speak Language (n/a), Spellcraft (Int), Swim (Str), Tumble (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).

- <b>Spells:</b> A bard casts arcane spells, which are drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a bard must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Cha 10 for 0-level spells, Cha 11 for 1st-level spells, and so forth). Starting at 8th level, and every three levels after, bards can replace one known spell with a new spell of the same level. The spell that can be replaced must be two spell levels below what the bard can currently cast (1st level spell at 8, 1st or 2nd level spell at 11, 1st or 2nd or 3rd level spell at 14, and so forth). Bards do not suffer from arcane spell failure when wearing light armor; medium and heavy armors, and shields still incur the normal failure chance.

- <b>Bardic Knowledge:</b> By virtue of his or her wide experience and knack for notable lore and tales, a bard PC has the unique ability to know relevant information regarding notable items, events, places, or persons.  This knowledge may be tested for by rolling a special "Bardic Knowledge" check, which is 1d20 + Bard level + Intelligence modifier.  Results of the check may be conveyed by a DM, in accordance with the following table:
 - DC10 Common, known by at least a substantial minority of the local population.
 - DC20 Uncommon but available, legends known by only a few people.
 - DC25 Obscure, known by few, hard to come by.
 - DC30 Extremely obscure, known by very few, possibly forgotten by most who once knew it, possibly known only by those who don't understand the significance of the knowledge.
This check also receives a +2 synergy bonus when the bard has 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (History).

- <b>Inspiration:</b> The very presence of a bard is a constant inspiration to his companions. Unlike bardic music, bardic inspirations are always active and do not have a limited number of uses, however, the bard may only use one inspiration at any given time. At 1st level, the bard can only inspire courage, but as he increases in level, he gains access to a variety of inspirations from which his companions (and himself) may benefit. There are seven types of inspirations:

* <b>Inspire Courage (1st level):</b> This gives a bonus to hit and damage. It starts at +1, and becomes +2 at 8th level, +3 at 14th level, and +4 at 20th level.

* <b>Inspire Competence (2nd level):</b> This gives a skill bonus to all allies. It starts at +2 and becomes +4 at 11th level and +6 at 19th level.

* <b>Inspire Defense (5th level):</b> This gives a dodge AC bonus to all allies. It starts at +2 and becomes +3 at 10th level, +4 at 15th level, and +5 at 20th level.

* <b>Inspire Regeneration (7th level):</b> This heals all party members a certain number of hit points every two rounds. This starts at 1 hit point and becomes 2 at 12th level, and 3 at 17th level.

* <b>Inspire Toughness (8th level):</b> This gives a bonus to saving throws for all allies. It starts at +1, then +2 at 13th level, and then +3 at 18th level.

* <b>Inspire Slowing (11th level):</b> All enemies that come within 20 feet of the bard have to make a Will save (DC 13 + ½ Bard level + CHA modifier) otherwise they will be slowed down. Initially they are slowed down 15% but at 16th level they are slowed by 30%. There are no further penalties besides movement, unlike the <i>slow</i> spell.

* <b>Inspire Jarring (14th level):</b> All enemies within 20' of the bard suffer a -4 penalty to all Concentration checks and -2 to all Will saves.

- <b>Bardic Music:</b> Once per day per bard level, a bard can use his song or poetics to produce magical effects on those around him (usually including himself, if desired). The bard's ranks in the Perform skill, and in some cases his bard level, determine what bard songs he can use. Bardic music has a duration of 10 rounds, unless an individual song specifies otherwise.

- <b>Countersong (Req: Perform 3):</b> This song puts a buff on the targeted ally that lasts for 10 rounds or until discharged. Any hostile magic spell that would affect the countersong's target has to make a Spell Resistance check of 10 + levels of bard the singer possesses. Whether the spell is blocked or not, the counter-song is discharged.

- <b>Fascinate (Req: Perform 3):</b> Every hostile creature within 90 feet must make a Will save (against a DC of 11 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Charisma modifier). This is an enchantment (compulsion) mind-affecting ability. If the target fails this save, then they are dazed for as long as the song is playing and the bard is within 90 feet of them. If a creature is attacked, or is within 10 feet of a creature being attacked, the effect ends for that creature, though anyone who fails their saving throw will be dazed for at least one round. There is a cool down of 10 rounds before this ability can be used again. Fascinate effects up to one enemy per level of the bard.

- <b>Haven Song (Req: 3rd level, Perform 6):</b> This song renders all enemies who fail a Will save (DC 11 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Charisma modifier) to be unable to attack the bard, unless  the bard takes hostile action against them or their allies (for example, attacking or casting a harmful spell). The Fascinate and Cloud Mind songs do not count as hostile actions.

- <b>Cloud Mind (Req: 6th level, Perform 9):</b> This is a more potent, single-target version of the Fascinate bard song. The saving throw DC is increased to 14 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Charisma modifier, and enemies being attacked nearby don't break the effect. There is a 5-round cool down before this ability can be used again.

- <b>Ironskin Chant (Req: 9th level, Perform 12):</b> This song provides damage reduction 5/- to the party for 4 rounds.

- <b>Song of Freedom (Req: 12th level, Perform 15):</b> At 12th level a bard gains a song that will break curses and enchantments on allies with a check of the bard's level at DC (11 + caster level of the effect to be dispelled)

- <b>Song of Heroism (Req: 15th level, Perform 18):</b> This song inspires either the bard or a single targeted ally. For 5 rounds, the inspired creature gains +4 dodge bonus to AC and +4 morale bonus to saving throws. Additionally the inspired creature gains +4 temporary hit points per level. There is a cool down of 20 rounds before this ability can be used again.

- <b>Legionnaire's March (Req: 18th level, Perform 21):</b> This song inspires all allies within 60 feet. The game determines the highest base attack bonus of all allies in the area of effect, and all affected characters now use this as their new base attack. All affected characters get a +4 competence bonus to damage rolls, as well. This ability lasts for 10 rounds. There is a cool down of 5 minutes (game time) before this ability can be used again.

The blackguard epitomizes evil. Consorting with demons and devils and serving dark deities, the blackguard is hated and feared by all. The blackguard has many options available to him--sending forth dark minions and servants to do his bidding, attacking with stealth and honorless guile, or straightforward smiting of the forces of good that stand in his way. Therefore, almost any class is suited to take the blackguard prestige class.

<5014><16782230>:Cleric
<5015><16782231>:<color=Gold><b>Cleric</b></color>

Clerics are masters of divine magic, which is especially good at healing. Even an inexperienced cleric can bring people back from the brink of death, and an experienced cleric can bring back people who have crossed over that brink. As channelers of divine energy, clerics can affect undead creatures. A cleric can turn away or even destroy undead. Clerics have some combat training. They can use simple weapons, and they are trained in the use of armor, since armor does not interfere with divine spells the way it does with arcane spells.

<b><i>ALFA Note: The requirements on this class have been altered to more closely match PnP canon rules.</i></b>
<color=Red>(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)</color>

A divine champion is the strong right arm of her deity. She serves as a guardian of holy sites, a protector of pilgrims, and a leader of crusades. Though paladins fill this role in many good-aligned churches, a divine champion may take up the banner of any deity, regardless of alignment or ethos. These holy warriors are loved by their patron's worshipers and hated by the church's enemies in equal measure. Most champions come from a combat or military background. Barbarians, fighters, paladins, and rangers are the most common candidates, through monks, clerics, and the more militant druids frequently pursue this path as well. 

<color=Gold>Requirements:</color>

- <b>Divine Wrath:</b> At 5th level, once per day, the divine champion is capable of channeling the awesome fury of his patron deity, granting him considerable bonuses in combat. He gains damage reduction 5/- and a +3 sacred bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage, and saving throws. The divine fury lasts for one round per point of Charisma bonus the divine champion has.
<5018><16782234>:Doomguide

<color=Red>(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)</color>

Those who worry about life after death turn to the doomguides of Kelemvor, an elite order of spellcasting warriors in service to the Judge of the Damned, to answer their fears with promises of a painless transition and a fair judgement in the afterlife. When not administering to the needs of those about to die, doomguides halt the spread of necromancy by cleansing the taint of unlife through careful application of faith, spells, and bladecraft. As both compassionate undertakers and vigorous foes of undead, doomguides represent the inherent dualism that defines death in the Realms. Doomguides come exclusively from the ranks of Kelemvor's clergy.

<color=Gold>Requirements:</color>

<b>Alignment:</b> Any Lawful.

<b>Skills:</b> Diplomacy 5 ranks, Knowledge (The Planes) 5 ranks.

<b>Feats:</b> Extra Turning, Great Fortitude

<b>Spells:</b> Level 3 divine spellcaster

<b>Deity:</b> Kelemvor

<color=Gold>Class Features:</color>

- <b>Hit Die:</b> d6

- <b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> High.

- <b>High Saves:</b> Will.

- <b>Spells Per Day:</b> At each doomguide level, the character gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class to which he belonged before adding the prestige class level. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained.

- <b>Kelemvor's Boon:</b> By the grace of the Lord of the Dead, doomguides add their doomguide class levels to their cleric levels for purposes turning or destroying undead, both for the initial turning check and the turning damage roll.

- <b>Bonus Feats:</b> Bonus Feats: At Level 2, the Doomguide gains Improved Turning. At level 3, they gain Extra Turning II. At level 6, they gain Divine Vengeance. At level 10, they gain Empower Turning and Extra Turning III.

- <b>Save Bonus:</b> At 4th level, doomguides get a +4 bonus on saving throws against death effects and to saving throws to overcome a negative level. Upon reaching 8th level, a doomguide always makes his saving throw to overcome a negative level.

- <b>Bond of <i>Fatal Touch</i> :</b> The doomguide's devotion to Kelemvor and dedication to the teachings of the Lord of the Crystal Spire has helped him to establish certain supernatural links to <i>Fatal Touch</i>, Kelemvor's powerful bastard sword. These links manifest in the form of a pale green nimbus around the weapon, representing the ability of a doomguide to increase the power of the weapons he wields.

The ability lasts for 1 round each time it is used, and can be invoked  a number of times per day equal to the doomguide's Charisma bonus (minimum one). A doomguide must decide to use the ability before attacking, and if the attack misses that use is wasted.

At 5th level, the bond grants wielded weapons the <i>ghost touch</i> property. At 7th level, weapons wielded by the doomguide gain both <i>ghost touch</i> and the <i>undead bane</i> properties. At 9th level, wielded weapons gain the <i>ghost touch, undead bane</i>, and <i>disruption</i> properties even if they are not bludgeoning weapons. The weapon's normal abilities still apply.

- <b>Ethereal Purge:</b> At 8th level, once per day the doomguide may surround himself with a sphere of power with a radius of 5 feet per class level that forces all concealed creatures in the area to manifest on or shift themselves to the Material Plane, as appropriate. Such creatures may attempt a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 doomguide's class level + doomguide's Wisdom bonus) to resist this effect. Those who fail suffer the above effects and are prevented from returning to concealment for 1 minute per class level.

- <b>Kelemvor's Grace:</b> At 10th level, a doomguide gains complete immunity to death effects. Furthermore, allies within 10 feet of him gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against death effects and to saving throws to overcome a negative level.
<5020><16782236>:Druid
<5021><16782237>:<color=Gold><b>Druid</b></color>

Druids cast divine spells much the same way clerics do, though most get their spells from the power of nature rather than from deities. Their spells are oriented toward nature and animals. In addition to spells, druids gain an increasing array of magical powers, including the ability to take the shapes of animals, as they advance in level. 

<color=Gold>Class Features:</color>

- <b>Alignment Restrictions:</b> Any neutral - druids, in keeping with nature's ultimate indifference, must maintain at least some measure of dispassion.

- <b>Hit Die:</b> d8

- <b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> Medium.

- <b>High Saves:</b> Fortitude and Will.

- <b>Weapon Proficiencies:</b> Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape.

- <b>Armor Proficiencies:</b> Light and medium as well as shield (except for tower shields).

- <b>Bonus Languages:</b> Druidic (Automatic), and Sylvan.

- <b>Spontaneous Casting:</b> A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can "lose" a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon monster</i> spell of the same level or lower.

- <b>Animal Companion:</b> A druid begins the game with an animal companion.

- <b>Nature Sense:</b> A druid gains a +2 bonus to Survival and a +2 bonus to Seach and Spot while in wilderness areas.

- <b>Venom Immunity:</b> At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.

- <b>Plant Shape:</b> At 12th level, a druid is able to wild shape into a plant creature - a shambling mound or a treant. Using this ability counts against her normal uses of wild shape.

- <b>Elemental Shape:</b> At 16th level, a druid becomes able to wild shape into an elemental (air, earth, fire, or water) once per day. These elemental forms do not count against her normal wild shape usage. In addition to the normal effects of wild shape, the druid gains all the elemental's extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities. At 18th level, a druid becomes able to assume elemental form twice per day, and at 20th level she can do so three times per day.
<5022><16782238>:Duelist
<5023><16782239>:<color=Gold><b>Duelist</b></color>

<b><i>ALFA Note: The requirements on this class have been altered to more closely match PnP canon rules.</i></b>
<color=Red>(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)</color>

The duelist is a nimble, intelligent fighter trained in making precise attacks with light weapons, such as the rapier. She always takes full advantage of her quick reflexes and wits in a fight. Rather than wearing bulky armor, a duelist feels the best way to protect herself is not to get hit at all. Duelists are most often fighters or rangers, but almost as often rogues or bards. Wizards, sorcerers, and monks make surprisingly good duelists due to those classes' lack of reliance on armor.

<color=Gold>Requirements:</color>

<b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> +6

<b>Skills:</b> Parry 5 ranks, Perform (Any) 3 ranks, Tumble 5 ranks.

<b>Feats:</b> Dodge, Mobility, Weapon Finesse.

- <b>Canny Defense:</b> When not wearing armor or using a shield, the duelist adds her intelligence bonus to her AC, with a maximum bonus equal to her Duelist level.

- <b>Improved Reaction:</b> At 2nd level, the duelist can improve her speed and reaction time, triggering the equivalent of the <i>haste</i> spell as if cast by a sorcerer of the duelist's class level. This ability can be used once per day at 2nd level, three times per day at 4th level, four times per day at 6th level, five times per day at 8th level, and 6 times per day at 10th level.

- <b>Enhanced Mobility:</b> At 3rd level, the duelist gains an additional +4 dodge bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity provoked by movement. This bonus stacks with that granted by the Mobility feat.

- <b>Grace:</b> At 4th level, the duelist gains a +2 bonus on Reflex saves.

- <b>Precise Strike:</b> At 5th level, the duelist's skill and precision allows her to inflict much more grievous wounds than her weapon might suggest. Whenever the duelist attacks with a light or one-handed piercing weapon, she adds 1d6 to her damage. This bonus increases to 2d6 at 10th level.

- <b>Flourish:</b> A 6th-level duelist can make an impressive, flashy attack with a light or one-handed piercing weapon that catches her foe off guard. This attack deals 2d6 additional points of piercing damage. There is no limit to the number of times per day the duelist may use this ability, but a 30-second "cool down" period is required between uses.

- <b>Elaborate Parry:</b> At 7th level, the duelist masters the art of defense with her blade. Whenever she wields a light or one-handed piercing weapon, she adds her duelist level to Parry checks.

- <b>Deflect Arrows:</b> A 9th-level duelist gains Deflect Arrows as a bonus feat.
<5024><16782240>:Dwarven Defender
<5025><16782241>:<color=Gold><b>Dwarven Defender</b></color>

<color=Red>(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)</color>

The dwarven defender is a sponsored champion of a dwarven cause, a dwarf aristocrat, a dwarven deity, or the dwarven way of life. As the name might imply, this character is a skilled combatant trained in the arts of defense. A line of dwarven defenders is a far better defense than a 10- foot-thick wall of stone, and much more dangerous. Most dwarven defenders are fighters, paladins, rangers, or clerics, although ex-barbarians, sorcerers, wizards, and druids can certainly all benefit from the defensive capabilities of this prestige class. Rogues, bards, and monks usually depend too heavily on mobility to use the abilities of the dwarven defender class to their fullest.

<color=Gold>Requirements:</color>

<b>Race:</b> Dwarf.

<b>Alignment:</b> Any lawful.

<b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> +7.

<b>Feats:</b> Dodge, Toughness.

A 1st-level dwarven defender can use this ability 1/day. He gains an additional use every two levels beyond 1st.

- <b>Improved Defense:</b> The dwarven defender receives a +1 dodge bonus to AC at 1st level. This bonus improves by an additional +1 at 4th, 7th, and 10th level.

- <b>Uncanny Dodge:</b> At 2nd level the dwarven defender retains his Dexterity bonus to AC even when caught flat-footed.

- <b>Trap Sense:</b> At 4th level the dwarven defender gets a +1 Reflex bonus against all traps. At 9th level this bonus increases by an additional +1.

- <b>Damage Reduction:</b> At 6th level, the dwarven defender gains DR 3/-. This increases to DR 6/- at 10th level.

- <b>Improved Uncanny Dodge:</b> At 6th level the dwarven defender can no longer be sneak attacked except by a rogue 4 or more levels higher than him.
<5026><16782242>:Eldritch Knight
<5027><16782243>:<color=Gold><b>Eldritch Knight</b></color>

<color=Red>(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)</color>

Studying the martial and arcane arts to equal degree, the eldritch knight is a versatile combatant who can cast a fireball on her foes or charge them with sword drawn. The eldritch knight takes pride in her ability to use the right technique for the job: spells against physically tough foes and force of arms against spellcasting enemies.

Eldritch knights split their time between physical training to become better soldiers and arcane study to learn more powerful spells. They tend to be driven individuals, because simultaneously perfecting their spellcasting and combat prowess requires immense time and effort.

<color=Gold>Requirements:</color>

<b>Feats:</b> Weapon Proficiency (Martial).

<b>Spellcasting:</b> Able to cast 3rd level arcane spells.

<color=Gold>Class Features:</color>

- <b>Hit Die:</b> d6

- <b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> High.

- <b>High Saves:</b> Fortitude.

- <b>Weapon Proficiencies:</b> None.

- <b>Armor Proficiencies:</b> None.

- <b>Bonus Feats:</b> The eldritch knight gains Combat Casting and Skill Focus (Concentration) at first level.

- <b>Arcane Spellcasting:</b> At each level (except 1st level) an eldritch knight gains new spells per day, plus another effective casting level, as if he progressed in an arcane spellcasting class that he had prior to becoming an eldritch knight. If a character has multiple arcane spellcasting classes when becoming an eldritch knight, he must choose which arcane spellcasting class will benefit from all levels of eldritch knight.

The favored soul follows the path of the cleric but is able to channel divine power with surprising ease. She is able to perform the same tasks as her fellow divine spellcasters but with virtually no study. Favored souls cast their spells naturally, as much through force of personality as through study. Though this gives them extraordinary divine abilities no normal person could ever match, they see their gift as a call to action, and so in some ways may lag behind their more studious colleagues.

<color=Gold>Class Features:</color>

- <b>Hit Die:</b> d8

- <b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> Medium.

- <b>High Saves:</b> All.

- <b>Weapon Proficiencies:</b> Simple weapons and deity's favored weapon.

- <b>Armor Proficiencies:</b>  Light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).

- <b>Bonus Languages:</b> Abyssal, Infernal, and Celestial

- <b>Skill Points:</b> 2 + Int modifier per level, x4 at first level.

- <b>Class Skills:</b> The Favoured Soul's class skills (and ability for each skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Jump (Str), Knowledge: Arcana (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis) and Spellcraft (Int)

- <b>Spells:</b> A favored soul casts divine spells which are drawn from the cleric spell list. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time the way a cleric must. To cast a spell, a favored soul must have a Charisma score of 10 + the spell's level (Cha 10 for 0-level spells, Cha 11 for 1st-level spells, and so forth). The Difficulty Class for  a saving throw against a favored soul's spell is 10 + the spell's level + the favored soul's Wisdom modifier. Unlike a cleric, a favored soul's selection of spells is limited, but at 4th level, and at every even-numbered favored soul level after that, the favored soul may swap a spell she already knows for another spell of the same level. In effect, the favored soul "loses" the old spell in exchange for the new one.

- <b>Deity's Weapon Proficiency:</b> Favored souls gain a weapon proficiency feat that allows them to use their deity's favored weapon. (For example, favored souls of Kelemvor will gain the Exotic Weapon Proficiency feat, enabling them to use a bastard sword.)

- <b>Deity's Weapon Focus:</b> At 3rd level, a favored soul gains the Weapon Focus feat with her deity's favored weapon.

- <b>Energy Resistance:</b> At 5th level, a favored soul chooses an energy type and gains resistance 10 against that type. At 10th level and 15th level, the character gains resistance 10 against another energy type of her choosing.

- <b>Deity's Weapon Specialization:</b> At 12th level, a favored soul gains the Weapon Specialization feat with her deity's favored weapon.

- <b>Haste:</b> At 17th level, a favored soul gains the ability to cast <i>haste</i> three times per day.

- <b>Damage Reduction:</b> At 20th level, a favored soul gains damage reduction. She may choose between damage reduction 10/silver or damage reduction 10/cold iron.
<5030><16782246>:Fighter
<5031><16782247>:<color=Gold><b>Fighter</b></color>

Of all the classes, the fighter has the best all around fighting capabilities (hence the name). Fighters are familiar with all the standard weapons and armors. In addition to general fighting prowess, each fighter develops particular specialties of his own. A given fighter may be especially capable with certain weapons; another might be trained to execute specific fancy maneuvers. As fighters gain experience, they get more opportunities to develop their fighting skills. Thanks to their focus on combat maneuvers, they can master the most difficult ones relatively quickly.

<color=Gold>Class Features:</color>

- <b>Hit Die:</b> d10

- <b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> High.

- <b>High Saves:</b> Fortitude.

- <b>Weapon Proficiencies:</b> Simple and martial weapons.

- <b>Armor Proficiencies:</b> All armor (light, medium, and heavy) and all shields (including tower shields).

- <b>Skill Points:</b> 2 + Int modifier per level,  x4 at first level.

- <b>Class Skills:</b> Craft The fighter's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Jump (Str), Parry (Dex), Ride (Dex), and Swim (Str).

- <b>Bonus Feats:</b> At 1st level, a fighter gets a bonus combat-oriented feat in addition to the feat that any 1st-level character gets and the bonus feat granted to a human character. The fighter gains an additional bonus feat at 2nd level and every two fighter levels thereafter (4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, and 20th). These bonus feats must be drawn from the feats noted as fighter bonus feats. A fighter must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including ability score and base attack bonus minimums.
<5032><16782248>:Frenzied Berserker

<color=Red>(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)</color>

The random madness of the thunderstorm and the unpredictability of the slaadi come together in the soul of the frenzied berserker. Unlike most other characters, she does not fight to achieve some heroic goal or defeat a loathsome villain. Those are mere excuses - it is the thrill of combat that draws her. For the frenzied berserker, the insanity of battle is much like an addictive drug - she must constantly seek out more conflict to feed her craving for battle. Because of their traditional love for battle, barbarians are the ones who most frequently adopt this prestige class. Spellcasting characters almost never become frenzied berserkers. 

<color=Gold>Requirements:</color>

<b>Alignment:</b> Any nonlawful.

<b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> +6

<b>Feats:</b> Cleave, Great Cleave, Power Attack.

<color=Gold>Class Features:</color>

- <b>Hit Die:</b> d12

- <b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> High.

- <b>High Saves:</b> Fortitude.

- <b>Weapon Proficiencies:</b> None.

- <b>Armor Proficiencies:</b> None.

- <b>Skill Points:</b> 2 + Int Modifier.

- <b>Class Skills:</b> Climb (Str), Intimidate (Cha), Jump (Str), Parry (Dex), Ride (Dex), and Swim (Str).

- <b>Toughness:</b> A 1st-level frenzied berserker gains Toughness as a bonus feat.

- <b>Frenzy:</b> A 1st-level frenzied berserker gains the ability to frenzy. Frenzy adds a +6 bonus to Strength (no Constitution bonus), imposes a -4 penalty to AC,  and gives the frenzied berserker a single extra attack at his highest Base Attack Bonus (this does not stack with Haste or other effects that add an additional attack). Each round of the frenzy, the frenzied berserker takes 12 points of damage. The effects last 3 + Constitution modifier rounds, after which the frenzied berserker is fatigued for 5 rounds, suffering -2 Strength, -2 Dexterity, and -10% movement penalties. Initially, this ability can be used once per day and at 3rd level and every odd level after that, the frenzied berserker gains an additional use per day. Bonuses and penalties (including fatigue effects) from Frenzy and Barbarian Rage stack with each other.

- <b>Supreme Cleave:</b> At 2nd level, whenever the frenzied berserker drops an opponent in melee, he gains two cleave attacks against an adjacent foe instead of one.

- <b>Deathless Frenzy:</b> At 4th level, when the frenzied berserker is frenzying he has the equivalent of the 4th level cleric spell <i>death ward</i> in place. The frenzied berserker is immune to any death spells, spell-like abilities, and death effects.

- <b>Enhanced Power Attack:</b> At 5th level, the frenzied berserker gains a +5 damage bonus using the Power Attack feat. Using the Improved Power Attack feat the frenzied berserker gains a +10 damage bonus.  This translates to +10 with two-handed weapons for standard Power Attack and +20 for Improved Power Attack.

- <b>Inspire Frenzy:</b> Specifics: At 6th level, the frenzied berserker can inspire Frenzy in all allies. This ability has no effect on the frenzied berserker, only the berserker's allies. The Frenzy effect adds a +6 bonus to Strength (no Constitution bonus), imposes a -4 penalty to AC,  and gives the subjects a single extra attack at their highest Base Attack Bonus (this does not stack with Haste or other effects that add an additional attack). Each round of the frenzy, the subjects takes 12 points of damage. The effects last 2 rounds, after which the subjects are fatigued for 2 rounds, suffering -2 Strength, -2 Dexterity, and -10% movement penalties. The frenzied berserker can use this ability once per day at 6th level, twice at 8th level, and three times at 10th level. Bonuses from Inspire Frenzy and Barbarian Rage do not stack, though penalties do. If both abilities are used, only the highest modifiers are applied and all penalties take effect.

- <b>Greater Frenzy:</b> At 7th level, the frenzied berserker gains a +10 bonus to Strength while frenzying instead of a +6.

- <b>Supreme Power Attack:</b> At 10th level, the frenzied berserker gains a +6 damage bonus using the Power Attack feat. Using the Improved Power Attack feat the frenzied berserker gains a +12 damage bonus.  This translates to +12 with two-handed weapons for standard Power Attack and +24 for Improved Power Attack.

The semi-secret organization known as the Harpers has members scattered all across the region. These individuals are dedicated to battling evil, discovering and preserving forgotten lore, and maintaining the balance between nature and civilization. Harper agents are the "field agents" of the Harper organization, acting directly to gather intelligence and eliminate threats to the greater good. Bards are the most common candidates fo the Harper agent prestige class, but they are by no means the only qualified characters. Rangers, rogues, sorcerers, and wizards all possess the diversity of skill and ability necessary to become Harper agents. Barbarians, fighters, and paladins rarely become Harper agents because they lack the subtlety for the work. 

A character can achieve a maximum of 5 levels in the Harper agent prestige class.

<color=Gold>Requirements:</color>

<b>Alignment:</b> Any nonevil.

<b>Skills:</b> Diplomacy 8 ranks, Knowledge (Local) 4 ranks, Sense Motive 2 ranks, Survival 2 ranks.

<b>Feats:</b> Negotiator

<b>Spellcasting:</b> You must have at least one level of a spellcasting class to become a Harper agent.

<color=Gold>Class Features:</color>

- <b>Hit Die:</b> d6

- <b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> Medium.

- <b>High Saves:</b> Will.

- <b>Weapon Proficiencies:</b> Simple weapons.

- <b>Armor Proficiencies:</b> Light armor.

- <b>Spells per Day / Spells Known:</b> Starting at second level and every level after that the Harper agent progresses in a selected spellcasting class. When the player first chooses this prestige class if they have multiple spellcasting classes they choose which one they advance in.

- <b>Harper Knowledge:</b> Like a bard, a Harper agent has a knack for picking up odds and ends of knowledge. This ability works exactly like the bardic knowledge ability of the bard class. If a Harper agent has bard levels, the character's Harper agent levels and bard levels stack for bardic knowledge.

- <b>Deneir's Eye:</b> At 2nd level, the Harper agent gains a +3 sacred bonus to saving throws against traps. This is a supernatural ability.

- <b>Lliira's Heart:</b> At 2nd level, the Harper agent gains a +2 sacred bonus to saving throws against mind-affecting spells. This is a supernatural ability.

- <b>Tymora's Smile:</b> At 3rd level, once per day, the Harper agent or a target receives a +2 sacred bonus on all saving throws for 5 turns. This is a supernatural ability.

- <b>Lurue's Voice:</b> At 4th level, the Harper agent may use this ability to cast <i>dominate animal</i> as per the spell, three times a day.

- <b>Mystra's Boon:</b> At 5th level, the Harper agent gains a +2 sacred bonus on all saves against spells.
<5036><16782252>:Hellfire Warlock

The hellfire warlocks are a secretive group of specialist warlocks who have mastered hellfire, a dangerous energy found only in the Nine Hells. By tapping into this infernal power, these characters learn to infuse their eldritch blasts with the dark power of hellfire.

<color=Gold>Requirements:</color>

<b>Skills:</b> Intimidate 6 ranks, Spellcraft 6 ranks, Knowledge (The Planes) 12 ranks.

<b>Spells:</b> Brimstone Blast or Hellrime Blast

<color=Gold>Class Features:</color>

- <b>Hit Die:</b> d6

- <b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> Medium.

- <b>High Saves:</b> Will.

- <b>Weapon Proficiencies:</b> Simple weapons.

- <b>Armor Proficiencies:</b> Light armor.  A warlock can use any of his invocations while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. A warlock wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure.

- <b>Skill Points:</b> 2 + Int Modifier.

- <b>Class Skills:</b> Concentration (Con), Disguise (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge: Arcana (Int), Knowledge: Religion (Int), Knowledge: The Planes (Int),  Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).

- <b>Hellfire Blast:</b> Whenever you use your eldritch blast ability, you can change your eldritch blast into a hellfire blast. A hellfire blast deals your normal eldritch blast damage plus an extra 2d6 points of damage per class level. If your blast hits multiple targets (for example, the eldritch chain or eldritch cone blast shape invocations), each target takes the extra damage. This damage is not fire damage. The Hellfire Warlock takes 1 point of Constitution damage each target hit in this manner.

- <b>Invoking:</b> At each level, you gain new invocations known, increased damage with eldritch blast, and an increase in invoker level as if you had also gained a level in the warlock class. You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained.

- <b>Resistance to Fire 10:</b> At 2nd level, you gain resistance to fire 10. This resistance stacks with any resistance to fire you have gained from warlock class levels.

- <b>Summon Baatezu:</b> At 2nd level, once per day, the Hellfire Warlock can randomly summon a powerful devil from the Nine Hells to fight for the party. Control of the Baatezu lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1D8 + the Hellfire Warlock's class level + their Charisma bonus.  When the ability expires, the caster loses dominance over the Baatezu - which can have disastrous consequences, as devils typically despise being bothered by lesser beings. The caster is advised not to leave this up to chance, and dispel this summons before this time is up, sending the Baatezu back to the Nine Hells - though the devil might not attack, this method is the <i>only</i> certain way of avoiding a violent confrontation with the angry creature. 

- <b>Hellfire Shield:</b>  Starting at 3rd level, you can call up hellfire to surround yourself with a protective barrier.  This barrier deals damage equal to your eldritch blast (including bonus damage from the hellfire blast ability). This barrier automatically strikes the target every round, which can attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Cha modifier). Each time this ability hits an enemy creature, you take 1 point of Constitution damage. Because the diabolical forces behind the power of hellfire demand part of your essence in exchange for this granted power, if you do not have a Constitution score or are somehow immune to Constitution damage, you cannot use this ability.
<5038><16782254>:Invisible Blade
<5039><16782255>:<color=Gold><b>Invisible Blade</b></color>

<b><i>ALFA Note: The requirements on this class have been altered to more closely match PnP canon rules.</i></b>
<color=Red>(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)</color>

Invisible blades are deadly fighters who prefer to use daggers and related weapons in combat. Their training and techniques with these weapons make them just as lethal as any well-armed fighter. Invisible blades enjoy cultivating misconceptions about the level of danger they present, and they relish any chance to demonstrate that the most unimposing weapons can be the most lethal.

<color=Gold>Requirements:</color>

<b>Skills:</b> Bluff 8 ranks, Sense Motive 6 ranks.

<b>Feats:</b> Feint, Two-Weapon Fighting, Weapon Focus (Dagger or Kukri).

<color=Gold>Class Features:</color>

- <b>Hit Die:</b> d6

- <b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> High.

- <b>High Saves:</b> Reflex.

- <b>Weapon Proficiencies:</b> Invisible blades gain no weapon proficiencies.

- <b>Armor Proficiencies:</b> Invisible blades gain no armor proficiencies.

- <b>Skill Points:</b> 4 + Int Modifier.

- <b>Class Skills:</b> Balance (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Escape Artist (Dex), Jump (Str), Hide (Dex), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Parry (Dex), Perform (Cha), Sense Motive (Wis), Spot (Wis), and Tumble (Dex).

- <b>Bleeding Wound:</b> At 1st level, when an invisible blade hits with a successful sneak attack, he inflicts a bleeding wound that deals 2 points of damage per round for 3 rounds. This damage stacks with previous damage caused by a Bleeding Wound attack. He must be either unarmed or wielding only light weapons in order to inflict a Bleeding Wound. At 3rd level, the damage increases to 4 points per round, and at 5th level, it increases to 6 points per round. Each level of Bleeding Wound counts as one die of sneak attack damage for purposes of class and feat prerequisites.

- <b>Unfettered Defense:</b> An invisible blade benefits from an increased survival instinct during combat. Because of this sixth sense, he adds 1 point of his Intelligence bonus (if any) per invisible blade level to his Armor Class in addition to any other modifiers he would normally receive. If the invisible blade is caught flat-footed or is otherwise denied his Dexterity modifier to Armor Class, he also loses this bonus. Unfettered Defense functions only when an invisible blade is not wearing armor and is not wielding a ranged weapon.

- <b>Feint Mastery:</b> At 5th level, an invisible blade armed with a light weapon becomes so sure of his ability to mislead opponents that he cannot roll less than 5 on his Bluff check when using the Feint feat.
<5040><16782256>:Monk
<5041><16782257>:<color=Gold><b>Monk</b></color>

The key feature of the monk is her ability to fight unarmed and unarmored. Thanks to her rigorous training, she can strike as hard as if she were armed and strike faster than a warrior with a sword. Though a monk casts no spells, she has a magic of her own. She channels a subtle energy, called <i>ki,</i> which allows her to perform amazing feats. The monk's best-known feat is her ability to stun an opponent with an unarmed blow. A monk also has a preternatural awareness that allows her to dodge an attack even if she is not consciously aware of it. As a monk gains experience and power, her mundane and <i>ki</i>-oriented abilities grow, giving her more and more power over herself and, sometimes, over others.

<color=Gold>Class Features:</color>

- <b>Alignment Restrictions:</b> Any lawful - a monk's training requires strict discipline.

- <b>Hit Die:</b> d8

-  <b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> Medium.

- <b>High Saves:</b> All.

- <b>Weapon Proficiencies:</b> Monks are proficient with certain basic peasant weapons and some special weapons that are part of monk training. The weapons with which a monk is proficient are club, crossbow (light or heavy), dagger, handaxe, javelin, kama, quarterstaff, shuriken, and sling.

- <b>Armor Proficiencies:</b> Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields - in fact, many of the monk's special powers require unfettered movement. When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses her AC bonus, as well as her fast movement and flurry of blows abilities.

- <b>Skill Points:</b> 4 + Int modifier per level, x4 at first level.

- <b>Class Skills:</b> The monk's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Balance (Dex), Climb (Str), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Hide (Dex), Jump (Str), Knowledge: Arcana (Int), Knowledge: Religion (Int), Listen (Wis), Move
Silently (Dex), Parry (Dex), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Spot (Wis), Swim (Str), and Tumble (Dex).

- <b>AC Bonus:</b> A monk has a sixth sense that lets her avoid even unanticipated attacks. When unarmored, the monk adds her Wisdom bonus (if any) to her AC. In addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to AC at 5th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every five monk levels thereafter (+2 at 10th, +3 at 15th, and +4 at 20th level). She loses these bonuses when she is immobilized or helpless, when she wears any armor, or when she carries a shield.

- <b>Flurry of Blows:</b> When unarmored, a monk may strike with a flurry of blows at the expense of accuracy. When doing so, she may make one extra attack in a round at her highest base attack bonus, but this attack takes a -2 penalty, as does each other attack made that round. When a monk reaches 5th level, the penalty lessens to -1, and at 9th level it disappears. When using flurry of blows, a monk may attack only with unarmed strikes or with special monk weapons (kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, shuriken, and siangham).

- <b>Unarmed Strike:</b> At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat.

- <b>Evasion:</b> A monk of 2nd level or higher can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save (such as a red dragon's fiery breath or a fireball), she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing light armor or no armor.

- <b>Fast Movement:</b> At 3rd level, a monk gains an enhancement bonus to her speed. A monk in armor (even light armor) loses this extra speed.

- <b>Still Mind:</b> A monk of 3rd level or higher gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells and effects from the school of enchantment.

- <b><i>Ki</i> Strike:</b> At 4th level, a monk's unarmed attacks are empowered with <i>ki.</i> Her unarmed attacks are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction. <i>Ki</i> strike improves with the character's monk level, becoming lawful for purposes of damage reduction at level 10 and adamantine for purposes of damage reduction at level 16.

- <b>Purity of Body:</b> At 5th level, a monk gains gains immunity to all diseases.

- <b>Wholeness of Body:</b> At 7th level or higher, a monk can heal her own wounds. She can heal a number of hit points of damage equal to twice her current monk level each day.

- <b>Improved Evasion:</b> At 9th level, a monk's evasion ability improves. She still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks such as a dragon's breath weapon or a fireball, but henceforth she takes only half damage on a failed save. 

- <b>Diamond Body:</b> At 11th level, a monk gains immunity to poisons of all kinds.

- <b>Diamond Soul:</b> At 13th level, a monk gains spell resistance equal to her current monk level + 10.

- <b>Quivering Palm:</b> Starting at 15th level, a monk can set up fatal vibrations within the body of another creature once per day. Unless the target makes a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the monk's level + the monk's Wis modifier), it dies.

- <b>Empty Body:</b> At 19th level, a monk gains the ability to fade from sight twice per day. The monk gains a 50% concealment bonus for a number of rounds equal to his class level.

- <b>Perfect Self:</b> At 20th level, a monk has tuned her body with skill and quasi-magical abilities to the point that she becomes a magical creature. The monk gains damage reduction 10/magic, which allows her to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a non-magical weapon or by any natural attack made by a creature that doesn't have similar damage reduction
<5042><16782258>:Paladin
<5043><16782259>:<color=Gold><b>Paladin</b></color>

Divine power protects the paladin and gives her special powers. It wards off harm, protects her from disease, lets her heal herself, and guards her heart against fear. A paladin can also direct this power to help others, healing their wounds or curing diseases. Finally, a paladin can use this power to destroy evil. Even a novice paladin can detect evil, and more experienced paladins can smite evil foes and turn away undead. 

<color=Gold>Class Features:</color>

- <b>Alignment Restrictions:</b> Lawful good. Paladins must be lawful good, and they lose their divine powers if they deviate from that alignment. 

- <b>Hit Die:</b> d10

- <b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> High.

- <b>High Saves:</b> Fortitude.

- <b>Weapon Proficiencies:</b> Simple and martial weapons.

- <b>Armor Proficiencies:</b> All types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields). 

- <b>Bonus Language:</b> Celestial

- <b>Skill Points:</b> 2 + Int modifier per level,  x4 at first level.

- <b>Class Skills:</b> The paladin's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge: Nobility and Royalty (Int), Knowledge: Religion (Int), Parry (Dex), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), and Sense Motive (Wis).

- <b>Smite Evil:</b> Once per day, a paladin may attempt to smite evil with one normal melee attack. She adds her Charisma bonus (if any) to her attack roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per paladin level. If the paladin accidentally smites a creature that is not evil, the smite has no effect, but the ability is still used up for that day. At 5th level, and at every five levels thereafter, the paladin may smite evil one additional time per day, to a maximum of five times per day at 20th level.

- <b>Divine Grace:</b> At 2nd level, a paladin gains a bonus equal to her Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving throws.

- <b>Lay on Hands:</b> Beginning at 2nd level, a paladin with a Charisma score of 12 or higher can heal wounds (her own or those of others) by touch. Each day she can heal a total number of hit points of damage equal to her paladin level times her Charisma bonus. For example, a 7th-level paladin with a 16 Charisma (+3 bonus) can heal 21 points of damage per day.

- <b>Aura of Courage:</b> Beginning at 3rd level, a paladin is immune to fear (magical or otherwise). Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects.

- <b>Divine Health:</b> At 3rd level, a paladin gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases (such as mummy rot and lycanthropy).

- <b>Turn Undead:</b> When a paladin reaches 4th level, she gains the ability to rebuke or destroy undead. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. She turns undead as a cleric of three levels lower would.

- <b>Spells:</b> Beginning at 4th level, a paladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the paladin spell list. A paladin must choose and prepare her spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, a paladin must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Wis 10 for 0-level spells, Wis 11 for 1st-level spells, and so forth).

- <b>Remove Disease:</b> At 6th level, a paladin can remove disease once per day. At 9th level and every three levels after that, the paladin can cure disease one more time per day.

Necromancy is usually a poor choice for arcane spellcasters - those who really want to master the deathless arts almost always pursue divine means. However, an alternative exists for those who desire power over undead but refuse to give up their arcane craft completely. Enter the pale master, who draws on a font of special lore that provides a macabre power all its own. Many pale masters still end up supplementing their arcane power with levels of divine magic. The mixture of "pale lore" and clerical abilities to sway, create, command and destroy undead can be a potent one. 

<color=Gold>Requirements:</color>

<b>Alignment:</b> Any non-good.

- <b>Class Skills:</b> Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Hide (Dex), Knowledge (All, Int), Listen (Wise), Move Silently (Dex), Profession (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).

- <b>Spells per Day/Spells Known:</b> When a new, odd-numbered pale master level is gained, the character gains new spells per day as though he had gained a level in whatever arcane spellcasting class gave him access to 3rd-level arcane spells. If the character had more than one applicable arcane spellcasting class, he must pick one to improve.

- <b>Bone Skin:</b> At 1st level, the pale master's tough, cadaverous flesh gives him a +2 natural armor bonus to AC. This bonus increases to +4 at 4th level and +6 at 8th level.

- <b>Animate Dead:</b> A 2nd-level pale master can use <i>animate dead</i> as a spell-like ability once per day.

The pale master may make a touch attack with this arm that paralyzes the target twice per day. At 8th level, the pale master may use this touch attack three times per day. At 10th level, the pale master's undead graft touch attack kills the target if it fails its save, instead of paralyzing it.

- <b>Tough as Bone:</b> At 7th level, the pale master becomes more and more like one of the implacable undead. He gains immunity to hold, paralysis, and stun effects.

- <b>Summon Greater Undead:</b> At 9th level, the pale master can use <i>summon greater undead</i> as a spell-like ability once per day.

- <b>Deathless Mastery:</b> At 10th level, the pale master is practically an undead creature himself. He gains immunity to critical hits.
<5046><16782262>:Ranger
<5047><16782263>:<color=Gold><b>Ranger</b></color>

A ranger can use a variety of weapons and is quite capable in combat. His skills allow him to survive in the wilderness, to find his prey, and to avoid detection. He also has special knowledge about certain types of creatures, which makes it easier for him to find and defeat such foes. Finally, an experienced ranger has such a tie to nature that he can actually draw upon natural power to cast divine spells, much as a druid does.

<color=Gold>Class Features:</color>

- <b>Hit Die:</b> d8

- <b>High Saves:</b> Fortitude and Reflex.

At 5th level, and every five levels after that, the ranger can choose an additional favored enemy and gains +1 to all favored enemy bonuses.

- <b>Combat Style:</b> At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. If the ranger selects archery, he is treated as having the Rapid Shot feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. If the ranger selects two-weapon combat, he is treated as having the Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. The benefits of the ranger's chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.
 
- <b>Toughness:</b> At 3rd level the ranger gains Toughness as a bonus feat.

- <b>Animal Companion:</b> At 4th level, a ranger gains an animal companion.

- <b>Spells:</b> Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list.

- <b>Swift Tracker:</b> At 8th level, a ranger can use their tracking skill and move at normal speed.

Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor or no armor. 

- <b>Combat Mastery:</b> At 11th level, a ranger's aptitude in his chosen combat style (archery or two-weapon combat) improves again.

It is known that certain dragons can take humanoid form and even have humanoid lovers. Sometimes a child is born of this union, and every child of that child unto the thousandth generation claims a bit of dragon blood, be it ever so small. Usually, little comes of it, though mighty sorcerers occasionally credit their powers to draconic heritage. For some, however, dragon blood beckons irresistibly. These characters become dragon disciples, who use their magical power as a catalyst to ignite their dragon blood, realizing its fullest potential. Members of this prestige class draw on the potent blood of red dragons coursing in their veins. Though red dragons are among the most cruel and evil creatures on Faerûn, red dragon disciples may be of any alignment.

This ability may be used once per day.

- <b>Blind-Fight:</b> At 5th level, the red dragon disciple gains the ability to fight well, even if blinded or against invisible creatures.

<color=Red>(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)</color>

<5052><16782268>:Rogue
<5053><16782269>:<color=Gold><b>Rogue</b></color>

Rogues are highly skilled, and they can concentrate on developing any of several categories of skills. While not equal to members of many other classes in combat, a rogue knows how to hit where it hurts, and she can dish out a lot of damage with a sneak attack. Rogues also have a sixth sense when it comes to avoiding danger. Experienced rogues develop mystical powers and skills as they master the arts of stealth, evasion, and sneak attacks. In addition, while not capable of casting spells on their own, rogues can "fake it" well enough to cast spells from scrolls, activate wands, and use just about any other magic item.

<color=Gold>Class Features:</color>

- <b>Hit Die:</b> d6

- <b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> Medium.

- <b>High Saves:</b> Reflex.

- <b>Weapon Proficiencies:</b> Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the rapier, shortbow, and short sword.

- <b>Armor Proficiencies:</b> Light armor.

- <b>Skill Points:</b> 8 + Int modifier per level, x4 at first level.

- <b>Class Skills:</b> The rogue's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Appraise (Int), Balance (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Decipher Script (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Int), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Forgery (Int), Gather Information (Cha), Hide (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Jump (Str), Knowledge (local) (Int), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Open Lock (Dex), Parry (Dex), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Search (Int), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spot (Wis), Swim (Str), Tumble (Dex), Use Magic Device (Cha), and Use Rope (Dex).

- <b>Sneak Attack:</b> If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and it increases by 1d6 every two rogue levels thereafter.

- <b>Trapfinding:</b> Rogues (and only rogues) can use the Search skill to locate traps when the task has a Difficulty Class higher than 20. Finding a nonmagical trap has a DC of at least 20, or higher if it is well hidden. Finding a magic trap has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it. Rogues (and only rogues) can use the Disable Device skill to disarm magic traps. A magic trap generally has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it.

- <b>Evasion:</b> At 2nd level and higher, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save (such as a red dragon's fiery breath or a fireball), she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. 

- <b>Trap Sense:</b> At 3rd level, a rogue gains an intuitive sense that alerts her to danger from traps, giving her a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses rise to +2 when the rogue reaches 6th level, to +3 when she reaches 9th level, to +4 when she reaches 12th level, to +5 at 15th, and to +6 at 18th level.

- <b>Uncanny Dodge:</b> Starting at 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She retains her Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if she is caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. However, she still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.

- <b>Improved Uncanny Dodge:</b> At 8th level a rogue cannot be sneaked attacked by another rogue, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target.

- <b>Special Abilities:</b> On attaining 10th level, and at every three levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th), a rogue gains a special ability of her choice from among the following options.
     - Crippling Strike (Ex): A rogue with this ability can sneak attack opponents with such precision that her blows weaken and hamper them. An opponent damaged by one of her sneak attacks also takes 2 points of Strength damage. 
     - Defensive Roll (Ex): The rogue can roll with a potentially lethal blow to take less damage from it than she otherwise would. Once per day, when she would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), the rogue can attempt to roll with the damage. To use this ability, the rogue must attempt a Reflex saving throw (DC = damage dealt). If the save succeeds, she takes only half damage from the blow; if it fails, she takes full damage. She must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to execute her defensive roll-if she is denied her Dexterity bonus to AC, she can't use this ability. Since this effect would not normally allow a character to make a Reflex save for half damage, the rogue's evasion ability does not apply to the defensive roll.
     - Improved Evasion (Ex): This ability works like evasion, except that while the rogue still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks such as a dragon's breath weapon or a fireball, henceforth she henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. 
     - Opportunist (Ex): The rogue automatically gains a +4 competence bonus to attack rolls when making an attack of opportunity.
     - Skill Mastery: The rogue cannot roll less than 5 whenever using the Disable Device, Open Lock, or Set Trap skills, even if in combat.
     - Slippery Mind (Ex): This ability represents the rogue's ability to wriggle free from magical effects that would otherwise control or compel her. If a rogue with slippery mind is affected by an enchantment spell or effect and fails her saving throw, she automatically gets one reroll.
     - Feat: A rogue may gain a bonus feat in place of a special ability.

Sacred fists are independent organizations found within many temples. Their ascetic members have turned their divine magic inward, bringing their bodies and wills into harmony. Sacred fists have forsworn the use of weapons and heavy armor. They consider their bodies and minds gifts from their deity, and they believe that not developing those gifts to their fullest potential is a sin. Spellcasting does not dishonor them or their deity. Sacred fists are strong in faith, will, and body. 

Clerics are excellent candidates for sacred fist orders. Paladins may also choose to join them, but are seldom comfortable surrendering the trappings of their calling. Fighters, rogues, bards, and even ex-monks may make good candidates, provided they have enough levels in a class that grants divine spells. Druids occasionally find the class's combat skills useful, but sorcerers and wizards find little to interest them.

If the character had more than one applicable divine spellcasting class, he must pick one to improve.

The additional damage is equal to the sacred fist's class level plus Wisdom modifier. This lasts 10 combat rounds. This ability initially can only be used once per day, increasing to twice per day at 8th level.

- <b>Uncanny Dodge:</b> At 6th level the sacred fist retains any Dexterity bonus to AC when flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker.

The organization known as the Shadow Thieves is one of the largest and most prosperous thieves' guild in all of the realm. Its success is derived from its system of interlocking guilds, each dedicated to the twin goals of profit and power. From the organization's stronghold in Amn, this series of guilds controls the lion's share of all criminal operations along the Sword Coast and beyond. As a member of a Shadow Thieves' guild, a shadow thief knows only her own minions, her coworkers, and her superior. This web of secrecy preserves the organization, because any members who are captured can sell out only a few others.

A character can achieve a maximum of 5 levels in the Shadow Thief prestige class.

Operating in the border between light and darkness, shadowdancers are nimble artists of deception. They are mysterious and unknown, never completely trusted but always inducing wonder when met. Rogues, bards, and monks make excellent shadowdancers. Fighters, barbarians, rangers, and paladins also find that shadowdancer abilities allow them to strike at their opponents with surprise and skill. Wizard, sorcerer, cleric, and druid shadowdancers employ the defensive capabilities inherent in the prestige class to allow them to cast their spells from safety and move away quickly. Despite their link with shadows and trickery, shadowdancers are as often good as evil.

<color=Gold>Requirements:</color>

<b>Skills:</b> Move Silently 8 ranks, Hide 10 ranks, Perform (Dance) 5 ranks.

<color=Gold>Class Features:</color>

<5060><16782276>:Sorcerer
<5061><16782277>:<color=Gold><b>Sorcerer</b></color>

Sorcerers cast spells through innate power rather than through careful training and study. Their magic is intuitive rather than logical. Sorcerers know fewer spells than wizards do and acquire powerful spells more slowly than wizards, but they can cast spells more often and have no need to select and prepare their spells ahead of time. Sorcerers do not specialize in certain schools of magic the way wizards sometimes do. Since sorcerers gain their powers without undergoing the years of rigorous study that wizards go through, they don't have the background of arcane knowledge than most wizards have. However, they do have more time to learn fighting skills, and they are proficient with simple weapons.

<color=Gold>Class Features:</color>

- <b>Hit Die:</b> d4

- <b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> Low.

- <b>High Saves:</b> Will.

- <b>Weapon Proficiencies:</b> Simple weapons.

- <b>Armor Proficiencies:</b> None. Armor of any type interferes with a sorcerer's arcane gestures, which can cause his spells to fail.

- <b>Bonus Language:</b> Draconic

- <b>Skill Points:</b> 2 + Int modifier per level,  x4 at first level.

- <b>Class Skills:</b> The sorcerer's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Bluff (Cha), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Knowledge: Arcana (Int), Profession (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).

- <b>Spells:</b> A sorcerer casts arcane spells, which are drawn primarily from the sorcerer/wizard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a sorcerer must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Cha 10 for 0-level spells, Cha 11 for 1st-level spells, and so forth). Starting at 6th level, and every two levels after, sorcerers can replace one known spell with a new spell of the same level. The spell that can be replaced must be two spell levels below what the sorcerer can currently cast (1st level spell at 6, 1st or 2nd level spell at 8, 1st or 2nd or 3rd level spell at 10, and so forth).

- <b>Familiar:</b> A sorcerer can obtain a familiar.
<5062><16782278>:Spirit Shaman
<5063><16782279>:<color=Gold><b>Spirit Shaman</b></color>

Master of the spirit world, the spirit shaman follows a different divine tradition than the cleric or druid. Her world is filled with powerful, living spirits, some helpful and some malign. By bargaining with these spirits, the spirit shaman gains power over the natural world and mighty divine magic with which to aid her comrades or smite her enemies. Creatures which are considered spirits include fey, elementals, and incorporeal undead such as wraiths and shadows.

<color=Gold>Class Features:</color>

- <b>Spells:</b> A spirit shaman casts divine spells, which are drawn from the druid spell list. Unlike the druid, a spirit shaman does not have to memorize his spells in advance, but he is only able to learn a limited number of spells. To cast a spell, a spirit shaman must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Wis 10 for 0-level spells, Wis 11 for 1st-level spells, and so forth). A spirit shaman's Charisma determines the Difficulty Check of his spells.

- <b>Spirit Guide:</b> Spirit shamans have a spirit guide, a personification of the spirit world, which exists only inside her mind and soul. The spirit guide grants the spirit shaman the Skill Focus: Listen feat at 1st level.

- <b>Chastise Spirits:</b> Beginning at 2nd level, a spirit shaman can deal 1d4 damage/shaman level to all spirits within 30 feet of herself. The affected spirits get a Will save (DC 10 + spirit shaman level + Charisma modifier) for half damage. This ability can be used a number of times per day equal to 3 + the shaman's Charisma modifier.

- <b>Detect Spirits:</b> At 3rd level, the spirit shaman gains the ability to use her spirit guide to detect any nearby spirits. Detected spirits will appear on the minimap. This effect lasts for 10 minutes.

- <b>Blessing of the Spirits:</b> At 4th level, the spirit shaman gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves against attacks and effects made by spirits. This effect may be dispelled, but the spirit shaman can reactivate it at will.

- <b>Follow the Guide:</b> A spirit shaman's spirit guide helps her maintain control of her mind.  At 5th level, if a spirit shaman is affected by a mind-affecting spell or effect and fails her saving throw, she can attempt it again immediately at the same DC. She only gets this one extra chance to succeed on her saving throw. This ability does not stack with similar abilities granted by other classes the spirit shaman may have.

- <b>Ghost Warrior:</b> At 6th level, the spirit shaman is able to strike spirits with unerring accuracy. The spirit shaman ignores all concealment and miss chance effects when fighting against spirits.

- <b>Warding of the Spirits:</b> At 7th level, the spirit shaman is able to grant his party members a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves against attacks and effects made by spirits. This ability is usable once per day and lasts for 10 minutes per shaman level. The effects from this ability do not stack with the spirit shaman's Blessing of the Spirits effect.

- <b>Spirit Form:</b> At 9th level, the spirit shaman gains the ability to become temporarily incorporeal once per day, gaining a 50% concealment bonus for 5 rounds. The spirit shaman can use this ability twice per day at 15th level, and three times per day at 20th level.

- <b>Recall Spirit:</b> At 11th level, the spirit shaman gains the ability to restore life to the recently deceased once per day. This effect is similar to the <i>raise dead</i> spell.

- <b>Weaken Spirits:</b> At 16th level, the spirit shaman can choose to strip all spirits within 30 feet of herself of their defensive abilities by expending a daily use of her Chastise Spirits ability. When a spirit is weakened, it loses its spell resistance, any damage reduction, and any miss chance or concealment effect it may have. This weakening effect lasts for 1 round plus 1 additional round for every 3 spirit shaman levels. Spirits that make their Will save (DC 10 + spirit shaman level + Charisma modifier) are unaffected by the weakening effect.

- <b>Spirit Journey:</b> At 17th level, the spirit shaman gains the ability to vanish bodily into the spirit world once per day. This effect lasts for 1 round per spirit shaman level, and during this time the spirit shaman cannot attack or be attacked.

- <b>Favored of the Spirits:</b> At 19th level, the spirit shaman can perform a special rite to guard herself from death. Under this protection, the spirit shaman instantly heals 10 hit points per spirit shaman level, up to 150 hit points, if she is reduced to 0 hit points. Once the rite's protection has been discharged, the spirit shaman must rest to regain the favor of the spirits.

- <b> Spirit Who Walks:</b> At 20th level, the spirit shaman becomes one with the spirit world. She gains damage reduction 5/cold iron, a +3 resistance bonus to saves against enchantments, and the Low-light Vision feat if she doesn't already have it.

<color=Red>(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)</color>

<5066><16782282>:Swashbuckler
<5067><16782283>:<color=Gold><b>Swashbuckler</b></color>

- <b>Insightful Strike:</b> At 3rd level, a swashbuckler becomes able to place her finesse attacks where they deal greater damage.  She applies her Intelligence bonus (if any) as a bonus on damage rolls (in addition to any Strength bonus she may have) with any light weapon, as well as any other weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse, such as a rapier.  Targets immune to sneak attacks or critical hits are immune to the swashbuckler's insightful strike.  A swashbuckler cannot use this ability when wearing medium or heavy armor or when encumbered.

- <b>Swashbuckler Dodge:</b> A swashbuckler is trained at focusing her defense on a single opponent in melee.  She gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC against melee attacks from her current target or last attacker.  This bonus increases by +1 at every five levels after 5th (+2 at 10th level, +3 at 15th, +4 at 20th, +5 at 25th, and +6 at 30th).  A swashbuckler loses this bonus when wearing medium or heavy armor or when encumbered.

- <b>Improved Flanking:</b> A swashbuckler of 8th level or higher who is flanking an opponent gains a +4 bonus on attacks instead of a +2 bonus on attacks.

- <b>Lucky:</b> At 11th level, a swashbuckler gains Luck of Heroes as a bonus feat.

- <b>Acrobatic Skill Mastery:</b> At 13th level, a swashbuckler becomes so certain in the use of her acrobatic skills that she can use them reliably even under adverse conditions.  When making a Tumble check, a swashbuckler cannot roll less than 5, even if in combat. 

- <b>Weakening Critical:</b> A swashbuckler of 14th level or higher who scores a critical hit against a creature also deals 2 points of Strength damage to the creature.  Creatures immune to critical hits are immune to this effect.

- <b>Slippery Mind:</b> When a swashbuckler reaches 17th level, her mind becomes more difficult to control. If the swashbuckler fails her save against an enchantment spell or effect, she automatically gets one reroll. She gets only this one extra chance to succeed at a certain saving throw.

-<b>Wounding Critical:</b>  A swashbuckler of 19th level or higher who scores a critical hit against a creature also deals 2 points of Constitution damage to the creature.  (This damage is in addition to the Strength damage dealt by the swashbuckler's weakening critical class feature.) Creatures immune to critical hits are immune to this effect.
<5068><16782284>:Warlock
<5069><16782285>:<color=Gold><b>Warlock</b></color>

Born of a supernatural bloodline, a warlock seeks to master the perilous magic that suffuses his soul. Unlike wizards, who approach arcane magic through the medium of spells, a warlock invokes powerful magic through nothing more than an effort of will. The font of dark magic burning in their souls makes them resistant to many forms of attack and arms them with dangerous power. Warlocks learn to harness their power to perform a small number of specific attacks and tricks called invocations. Warlocks make up for their lack of versatility by being tougher and more resilient than sorcerers or wizards.

<color=Gold>Class Features:</color>

- <b>Alignment:</b> Any evil or any chaotic.

- <b>Hit Die:</b> d6

- <b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> Medium.

- <b>High Saves:</b> Will.

- <b>Weapon Proficiencies:</b> Simple weapons.

- <b>Armor Proficiencies:</b> Light armor.  A warlock can use any of his invocations while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. A warlock wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure.

- <b>Bonus Languages:</b> Abyssal and Infernal.

- <b>Skill Points:</b> 2 + Int modifier per level,  x4 at first level.

- <b>Class Skills:</b> The Worlock's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Bluff (Cha), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Disguise (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Jump (Str), Knowledge: Arcana (Int), Knowledge: The Planes (Int), Knowledge: Religion (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis) and Spellcraft (Int).


- <b>Invocations:</b> A warlock does not prepare or cast spells as other wielders of arcane magic do. Instead, he possesses a repertoire of attacks, defenses, and abilities known as invocations that require him to focus the wild energy that suffuses his soul. A warlock can use any invocation he knows at will.

- <b>Eldritch Blast:</b> A warlock attacks his foes with eldritch power, using baleful magical energy to deal damage and sometimes impart other debilitating effects. An eldritch blast deals 1d6 points of damage at 1st level and increases in power as the warlock rises in level. There is no saving throw with this attack, but spell resistance can negate it. This power can be used at will.

- <b>Eldritch Lore:</b> At 2nd level the warlock gains a +2 bonus to his Lore and Spellcraft skills.

- <b>Damage Reduction:</b> Fortified by the supernatural power flowing in his body, a warlock becomes resistant to physical attacks at 3rd level and above, gaining damage reduction 1/cold iron (damage from attacks are reduced by 1 point unless the damage comes from cold iron). At 7th level and every four levels thereafter, a warlock's damage reduction improves.

- <b>Deceive Item:</b> At 4th level, a warlock gains a +4 bonus to his Use Magic Device skill.

- <b>Fiendish Resilience:</b> Beginning at 8th level, a warlock can activate this ability once per day. For 20 rounds, the warlock heals 1 hit point a round. This improves at 13th level to 2 hit points of healing a round, then at 18th level it becomes 5 hit points a round.

- <b>Energy Resistance:</b> At 10th level and higher, a warlock has resistance 5 against any two of the following energy types: acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic. Once the types are chosen, the resistances can't be changed. At 20th level, a warlock gains resistance 10 to his chosen energy types.

- <b>Eldritch Essence:</b> Some of a warlock's invocations, such as frightful blast, modify the damage or other effects of the warlock's eldritch blast. Unless otherwise noted, the eldritch blast deals normal damage in addition to the effect of the essence. The warlock can apply only one essence to a blast at a time. 

- <b>Blast Shape:</b> These invocations modify the range, target(s), or area of a warlock's eldritch blast. Unless otherwise noted, the eldritch blast does normal damage.

<color=Red>(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)</color>

Warpriests are fierce, earthy clerics who pray for peace but prepare for war. Their strong wills, powerful personalities, and devotion to their deities make them fearsome combatants.

- <b>Divine Spellcasting:</b> At each even-numbered level, warpriests gain new spells per day and an added level of effective spellcasting in whatever divine spellcasting class gave them access to 4th-level divine spells when becoming a warpriest. If a character has multiple classes that give him access to 4th-level divine spells, he must choose which spellcasting class will benefit from warpriest levels when first selecting this prestige class.

- <b>War Glory:</b> All allies within 10' of the warpriest have +1 to hit, though the warpriest himself does not gain this bonus. All enemies within the same range suffer a -1 morale penalty to saving throws and this penalty cannot be resisted in any way (though leaving the radius instantly cancels the effect). This power is always active.

- <b>Inflame:</b> Starting at 2nd level, a warpriest can use this ability to grant himself and all allies within 40' a bonus to saving throws vs. fear and mind effects for five rounds. This bonus is +2 at level 2 and becomes +4 at level 4, +6 at level 6 and +8 at level 10.
 
- <b>Remove Fear:</b> A warpriest may cast the <i>remove fear</i> spell once per day per level of warpriest.

- <b>Mass Cure Light Wounds:</b> Upon reaching 3rd level, a warpriest may cast <i>mass cure light wounds</i> once per day as a spell-like ability. The warpriest's class level is used to determine the caster level of this spell.

- <b>Fear Aura:</b> At 5th level, a warpriest can create an aura of fear that affects all enemies within 20'. Foes must make a Will save (DC 10 + warpriest class level + Cha modifier) or be affected by the <i>fear</i> spell. This power can be used once per day.

- <b>Battletide:</b> At 6th level, a warpriest can cast <i>battletide</i> as a spell-like ability once per day. The warpriest's class level is used to determine the caster level of this spell.

- <b>Haste:</b> At 7th level, a warpriest can cast <i>haste</i> as a spell-like ability three times per day. The warpriest's class level is used to determine the caster level of this spell.

- <b>Mass Heal:</b> At 9th level, a warpriest can cast <i>mass heal</i> as a spell-like ability once per day. The warpriest's class level is used to determine the caster level of this spell.

- <b>Implacable Foe:</b> At 10th level, a warpriest can bestow all allies within 30' (though not himself) an extra +20 hit points. This ability halves the warpriest's movement for 10 rounds. After ten rounds, all recipients lose 20 hit points. This ability may be used once per day.
<5072><16782288>:Weapon Master
<5073><16782289>:<color=Gold><b>Weapon Master</b></color>

<color=Red>(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)</color>

For a weapon master, perfection is found in the mastery of a single melee weapon. A weapon master seeks to unite this weapon of choice with the body, to make them one and to use the weapon as naturally and without thought as any other limb. Weapon Masters may not choose Unarmed Strike as their Weapon of Choice.

<color=Gold>Requirements:</color>

<b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> +5

<b>Feats:</b> Weapon Focus in a melee weapon, Dodge, Mobility, Combat Expertise, Spring Attack and Whirlwind Attack.

<b>Skills:</b> Intimidate 4 or more ranks.

<color=Gold>Class Features:</color>

- <b>Hit Die:</b> d10

- <b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> High.

- <b>High Saves:</b> Reflex.

- <b>Weapon Proficiencies:</b> None.

- <b>Armor Proficiencies:</b> None.

- <b>Skill Points:</b> 2 + Int Modifier.

- <b>Class Skills:</b> Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Intimidate (Cha), Parry (Dex), and Ride (Dex).

- <b>Weapon of Choice:</b> When a character acquires his first level of weapon master, he must select a single melee weapon type (for example, longsword or dwarven waraxe) as his weapon of choice. His weapon master abilities only function when he has a weapon of that type equipped.

- <b><i>Ki</i> Damage:</b> Once per day, a 1st-level weapon master may choose to make a special attack with his weapon of choice. If this attack hits, it automatically inflicts maximum damage.

- <b>Increase Multiplier:</b> At 5th level, the weapon master's critical multiplier with his chosen weapon increases by +1. (i.e. x2 becomes x3, x3 becomes x4, etc.)
 
- <b>Superior Weapon Focus:</b> A 5th-level weapon master gains Superior Weapon Focus with his weapon of choice as a bonus feat. 

- <b><i>Ki</i> Critical:</b> At 7th level, the weapon master increases his threat range by 2 when using his weapon of choice. For example, a longsword normally has a threat range of 19-20. In the hands of a 7th-level weapon master, it threatens on a 17-20.
<5074><16782290>:Wizard
<5075><16782291>:<color=Gold><b>Wizard</b></color>

The wizard's strength is her spells. Everything else is secondary. She learns new spells as she experiments and grows in experience, and she can also learn them from other wizards. In addition to learning new spells, a wizard can, over time, learn to manipulate her spells so they go farther, work better, or are improved in some other way. Some wizards prefer to specialize in a certain type of magic. Specialization makes a wizard more powerful in her chosen field, but it denies her access to some of the spells that lie outside that field.

<color=Gold>Class Features:</color>

- <b>Hit Die:</b> d4

- <b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> Low.

- <b>High Saves:</b> Will.

- <b>Weapon Proficiencies:</b> Wizards are proficient with the club, dagger, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, and quarterstaff.

- <b>Armor Proficiencies:</b> None. Armor of any type interferes with a wizard's movements, which can cause her spells to fail.

- <b>Bonus Language:</b> Draconic

- <b>Skill Points:</b> 2 + Int modifier per level, x4 at first level.

- <b>Class Skills:</b> The wizard's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Decipher Script (Int), Knowledge (all skills, taken individually) (Int), Profession (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).

- <b>Spells:</b> A wizard casts arcane spells, which are drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list. A wizard must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time. To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the wizard must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Int 10 for 0-level spells, Int 11 for 1st-level spells, and so forth). 

- <b>Bonus Feats:</b> At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level, a wizard gains a bonus feat. At each such opportunity, she can choose a metamagic feat, an item creation feat, or Spell Mastery. The wizard must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including caster level minimums.

- <b>Familiar:</b> A wizard can obtain a familiar.

- <b>Spellbook:</b> A wizard must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells. She cannot prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook. A wizard begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard spells (except those from her prohibited school or schools, if any) plus three 1st-level spells of your choice. For each point of Intelligence bonus the wizard has, the spellbook holds one additional 1st-level spell of your choice. At each new wizard level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new wizard level) for her spellbook. For example, when a wizard attains 5th level, she can cast 3rd-level spells. At this point, she can add two new 3rd-level spells to her spellbook, or one 2nd-level spell and one 3rdlevel spell, or any combination of two spells between 1st and 3rd level. At any time, a wizard can also add spells found in other wizards' spellbooks to her own.
<5076><16782292>:Knight Protector
<5077><16782293>:<color=Gold><b>Knight Protector</b></color>

<color=Red>(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)</color>

Knight Protectors swear themselves to an organization or a specific ward, guarding their chosen with their life.  Knight Protectors are selfless warriors with the power to shield others from harm and react to dangerous situations with little delay.  While a bodyguard by title, a Knight Protector isn't strictly defensive; they are trained to kill swiftly, not to endlessly absorb punishment until reinforcements arrive.  Knight Protectors come from all walks of life, and many lawful and good organizations, though the job is most suited to fighters, paladins and rangers.

A character can achieve a maximum of 5 levels in the Knight Protector prestige class.

<color=Gold>Requirements:</color>

<b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> +6

<b>Special:</b> Must be accepted as a Knight Protector by an organization or sponsor.

<color=Gold>Class Features:</color>

- <b>Hit Die:</b> d8

- <b>Protective Aura:</b> At 1st level, Knights gain an aura that grants +2 to all saving throws and +1 deflection bonus to armor class for all allies within 10 feet. This bonus does NOT apply to the Knight, only to their allies. At 4th level, this bonus increases to +3 saving throws, +2 deflection bonus and the protection extends to allies within 15 feet.

- <b>Guarding the Lord:</b> Beginning at 2nd level, Knights can protect one selected ally within 30 feet. This protection acts as the shield other spell cast at the Knight's character level. The only difference with the spell is that the target only takes 30% damage (instead of 50%) and the Knight takes half the initial damage rounded down (instead of the remaining). This ability can be used three times per day.

- <b>Frantic Reactions:</b> At 3rd level, Knights can rush across the battlefield and defeat the enemies plaguing their allies. This translates to a 10% increase in movement speed, +2 bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity provoked by movement and +2d6 sneak attack damage.

- <b>All-Out Assault:</b> At 5th level, Knights can concentrate for a round and focus their strength, making all of their melee attacks for the next three rounds inflict maximum damage. However, at the end of each of these three rounds, the Knight takes 10 points of damage from the incredible strain. This ability can be used once per day.

Bahamut, also referred to as the God of Dragons or the Lord of the North Wind, is a powerful platinum dragon and the king of the good dragons.

Sages continue to debate whether he is actually a diety or not.  According to draconic legend, he has existed since the beginning of time (which, in a dragon's reckoning is since the first dragon appeared on Toril).  Whatever he is, he is certainly powerful and venerated by many good dragons and respected by evil ones.  One of the most compassionate beings in Realmspace, his name is known throughout the Realmspace and in some aspect all over Toril.

The Brotherhood of the Glorious Sun has long existed within the church of Lathander, tolerated by other followers of the Morninglord and preaching that Lathander is the reincarnated form of Amaunator.  Heretics of the Risen Sun take the Brotherhood's beliefs one step further into heresy, by preaching that the time of Lathander's transformation is nigh and Amaunator is about to return.

The leader of the Brotherhood of the Glorious Sun, Sunlord Daelegoth Orndeir, has embraced the Risen Sun heresy and now seeks to make it the orthodox sect of the church of Lathander.  By the Year of Lightning Storms (1374 DR), Daelegoth has already begun a drive to recruit converts to the faith of Amaunator through preaching and performing miracles.

<b>ALFA Cleric Domains:</b> Good, Law, Sun.

Horus-Re (hore-us ray) is a confident deity who believes strongly in the Mulhorandi concept of maat (justice, honor, order, and righteousness). More than a code of chivalry, maat is the natural state of the universe and all things are expected to conform to it. Only by doing so can the citizens of Mulhorand be at peace with the gods and live a happy life. Horus-Re believes that Mulhorand is eternal, and to promote eternity, one must deny change, so Horus-Re tries to discourage change.
Clerics of Horus-Re pray for their spells at high sun, the most important ceremony of the day, when Horus-Re shines brightly over all Mulhorand.

 <b>Dogma</b>

Goodness, honor, and order are the natural state, and that which leads to evil, treachery, and chaos is by rights unnatural and the enemy. Lead by example, and let your deeds speak your intentions. Goodness and harmony come from living within maat rather than fighting it. Laws exist to bring prosperity to those under them. The pharaoh and the church of Horus-Re rule with Horus-Re's guidance and set laws as guidelines for honorable action within Mulhorand's tradition. Make no hasty changes or decisions, as their consequences are always suspect and may undermine the steadfast rule of eternity. Protect the weak and avenge all wrongs. Smite traitors with righteous vengeance.

  Jannath, more commonly referred to as the Earthmother, is a goddess of nature, wild places, and the natural order of things. She advocates a simple life, conducted in harmony with one's environs and the beasts that live within it. The Moonshaes are her specific charge, because she and the islands are one and the same, and all who dwell upon them are her children. When the Moonshaes suffer, Jannath's power wanes. When they prosper, she grows in strength.

The druids of Jannath associate no images with her, as she is all around them, all the time. Although her symbol is often shown as the Tree of Life (said to be within Myrloch Vale), in truth any aspect of the natural world can serve as her symbol, whether it be a songbird, or a towering oak. The air is her breath, the earth her body; her essence is in everything that lives on the Moonshaes.

It is commonly believed by foreigners that Jannath is an aspect of Chauntea, the faerûnian goddess of agriculture.  Jannath regards agriculture kindly enough, but not when it begins to dominate the land. According to the Earthmother, wild places are sacred and must be preserved. 

Dogma: There is balance in all things, and all is a cycle. Find your place in this dance and be content with it. Wild places must be preserved, for they are the cradle of life, and all life must be respected. Particularly your own. Do not complicate your existence by making things more difficult for yourself than they have to be. Live a life that is simple and pure. Do not covet more than you need. Nature provides all that you need, and to claim more than that is to invite misfortune.

Isis (pronounced eye-sys ) is a kind deity that takes joy in revealing new discoveries to her followers. She is known as Isharia in Thay, and by the name Ishtar in Unther.

The clergy of the church of Isis is primarily composed of human women of Mulan descent, though a few half-elves also follow the Bountiful Lady. These priestesses must study arcane magics as well as divine.
Clerics of Isis spend much of their time administering to the agricultural needs of Mulhorand, as well as the needs of typical home life.
Worship of Isis is seen most often among the common people of Mulhorand.

Clerics of Isis typically wear a white linen dress with sandals. They usually wear a wig over shaved heads, and paint three blue circles on their forehead as a symbol of their status as a priest of Mulhorand.
When preparing for combat, priestess of Isis tend to shy from the use of armor. They otherwise equip them selves practically for the situation.
Divine spellcasters of Isis pray for spells before the first meal of the day.
<6230><16783446>:Path of Enlightenment
<6231><16783447>:<color=Gold><b>PATH OF ENLIGHTENMENT</b></color>

<b>Aliases:</b><i> The True Path, The Way of Enlightenment</i>

The Path of Enlightenment, or the True Path, and known in Kozakura as the Way of Enlightenment, is the state religion of both Shou Lung and Wa and a popular one in Kozakura and other Kara-Turan countries. It is a major religion of much of Kara-Tur and the Hordelands.

The Path of Enlightenment is based on a written code of behavior and beliefs believed to have been created by the Celestial Emperor in order that the mortal world and the Celestial Heaven mirror one another in the process of attaining perfection. They admonish people to:

<i>
- "Honor that which has gone before you. For the past is eternal."

- "Honor and respect your Elders and the Ancestors. Show honor in word, thought, action, and deed."

- "Speak not false words, nor engage in false deeds, for these are not li."

- "Do honor to he who rules you, for the Earth is the Mirror of Heaven, and the Son of Heaven is the mirror of the Celestial One. Be obedient to your lord."

- "Engage in no base thing, nor commit murder, for to strike another in the name of anger is not li."

- "Do honor to those you must rule, for under the eye of Heaven, they are your equals. Be fair to those you rule."

- "Know that all things are One under Heaven, even the lowliest of creatures."
</i>

In these commandments, li was a term meaning "rightness under heaven." Nine cardinal virtues were also emphasized by the Path: in alphabetical order, these were Artistry, Compassion, Courage, Fidelity, Honor, Karma, Love, Respect for Tradition, and Scholarship.

The Path of Enlightenment is conveniently oriented to serve the wishes of the Imperial Family. It encourages fealty and obedience to one's lord, veneration of the past (including past emperors), and those who teach and guard the path. Its very nature deifies the person of the Emperor, elevating him to the very side of the Celestial One in importance, and conferring upon him a secret animal name upon his death.

As the Celestial One's mirror upon the Earth, the Emperor has the right to speak directly to the Immortals as an equal, as well as to call upon the spirits of the Ancestral Emperors, whether in his direct family line or not. He does this in the Heart of the Place Most Secret, a shrine located in the very center of the Forbidden City, and known only to him and his most trusted wu jen. He must also perform all the proper rites, such as plowing the first fields with a silver plow at the start of the New Year (to ensure good harvest), and traveling to the Mountains of the Immortals to make the yearly rituals and sacrifices.
<6232><16783448>:The Way
<6233><16783449>:<color=Gold><b>THE WAY</b></color>

The Way is a faith dominant in Shou Lung, T'u Lung, and other lands of Kara-Tur. The followers of the Way are known as Chung Tao, or Guides of the Way. The Way is much more of a philosophy than a religion, because its adherents believe that the true nature of the Way is unknowable. Its shrines are more like hermitages, and its very few temples organized as monasteries or schools, teaching a wide variety of subjects. The Way states that all things in the Celestial Universe affect and are affected by all others. There is no Good, Evil, Law or Chaos -- only the forces of the Universe, which may be manipulated as desired. The proper student of the Way thus recognizes this and strives to know the proper way in which to use these forces.

A Chung Tao priest is actually something more of a wizard than a monk or scholar, and both dang-ki (shukenja) and wu jen may be followers of the Way. Powerful positions within the faith are occupied by mages or sorcerers more often than priests, and indeed, many of the great wu jen of history have been Chung Tao priests as well.

The use of power is often the subject of debate, and so it is among the Chung Tao priests. In the earliest days of the Empire, this caused a great rift in the unified faith, with two main temple emerging from the chaos. One group, known as the Black Chung Tao, believe that the superior man has a duty to shape the universe to his ends; directing the unenlightened of the Earth to a higher goal. The second group, known as the White Chung Tao, believe that there are no superior men, only enlightened, ones, and that the proper observance of the Way is in maintaining the natural balance of events. The two sects are distinguished by an identifying mark worn on the chest or sewn on the garments. This symbol, representing the concept of Yin and Yang, is a circle with one half black and one half white. Within the center of each area is a small dot of the opposing color, symbolizing that each half is partially composed of the other. Among Black Chung Tao, the black side is uppermost -- among Whites, the white side is uppermost.
<6234><16783450>:Faith of the Nine Travelers
<6235><16783451>:<color=Gold><b>FAITH OF THE NINE TRAVELERS</b></color>

<b>Aliases:</b><i> The Nine Travelers, The Nine Immortals</i>

The Faith of the Nine Travelers, or simply "the Nine Travelers," is a faith common in Shou Lung and Wa in Kara-Tur.

The Faith of the Nine Travelers is less a faith or religion and more a set of customs and a philosophy. It holds that Heaven is a vast mirror of the empire of Shou Lung, with its own empire, government, bureaucracy, and emperor. All of this in fact is believed to describe the Celestial Empire, which held spiritual authority over Kara-Tur: nevertheless, outsiders tend to disbelieve it out of hand, for the simple fact that it seemed so banal and mundane.

In particular, adherents follow the Nine Immortals, also known as the Nine Travelers, and held that they were enormously powerful beings of the Celestial Bureaucracy. Each is followed by a different sect; believers argue about which of the Nine is the leader.

A fundamental tenet of the faith is that even the lowest commoner could rise to become a ruler. This view is openly commended by the nobility but of course not exactly encouraged.

As a religion, the Faith of the Nine Travelers is perhaps the least powerful of the faiths in Kara-Tur. It has no organized priesthood and very few temples. Instead, its true power lays in the many people of the lower classes and the bureaucracy who follow it.
<6236><16783452>:Eight Million Gods
<6237><16783453>:<color=Gold><b>EIGHT MILLION GODS</b></color>

This ancient Kozakuran religion is a collection of beliefs and rituals that relate to various nature deities. There is no great teacher or book for the Eight Million Gods, or uniform rituals of worship. Observances vary from deity to deity and shrine to shrine.

Shrines dedicated to the Eight Million Gods fall into two categories. First shrines and normal shrines. First shrines have been officially recognized and supported by the emperor and other nobles for centuries. They are often located in the old districts of cities and provincial capitals, and are larger and more powerful than other shrines. Many establish branches in other provinces to promote their particular beliefs and acquire a larger economic base of support.

Normal shrines are often built and supported by local peasantry. They may commemorate past events, ensure good harvests, ward off evil influences, or even appease powerful evil beings. Local nobility also support shrines, particularly in towns or villages near their homes.

Regardless of the type, most shrines are independent and unrelated to others. They are usually associated with a site of natural beauty or legendary significance, and may be found on the slopes of major mountains, along riverbanks, by the sea, or hidden away in forests. Many important shrines are dedicated to the sun goddess and the emperor, who is believed to be of divine ancestry.

Worship at these places often consists of ritual purification, offerings of food or donations of money, and prayers. At least once a year major shrines have more elaborate festivals, involving sacred dances, bonfires, and processions through the streets.

<9701><16786917>:Eldritch Knight
<9702><16786918>:<color=Gold><b>Eldritch Knight</b></color>

<color=Red>(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)</color>

Studying the martial and arcane arts to equal degree, the eldritch knight is a versatile combatant who can cast a fireball on her foes or charge them with sword drawn. The eldritch knight takes pride in her ability to use the right technique for the job: spells against physically tough foes and force of arms against spellcasting enemies.

Eldritch knights split their time between physical training to become better soldiers and arcane study to learn more powerful spells. They tend to be driven individuals, because simultaneously perfecting their spellcasting and combat prowess requires immense time and effort.

<color=Gold>Requirements:</color>

<b>Classes</b> A level in a class proficient in martial weapons (fighter, barbarian, ranger or paladin).

<b>Spellcasting:</b> Able to cast 3rd level arcane spells.

<color=Gold>Class Features:</color>

- <b>Hit Die:</b> d6

- <b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> High.

- <b>High Saves:</b> Fortitude.

- <b>Weapon Proficiencies:</b> None.

- <b>Armor Proficiencies:</b> None.

- <b>Skill Points:</b> 2 + Int modifier.

- <b>Class Skills:</b> Concentration, Craft Alchemy, Craft Armor, Craft Trap, Craft Weapon, Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (nobility and royalty), Ride, Sense Motive, Spellcraft, and Swim.

- <b>Bonus Feats:</b> The eldritch knight gains a bonus feat chosen from the fighter's list of bonus feats at 1st level.

- <b>Arcane Spellcasting:</b> At each level (except 1st level) an eldritch knight gains new spells per day, plus another effective casting level, as if he progressed in an arcane spellcasting class that he had prior to becoming an eldritch knight. If a character has multiple arcane spellcasting classes when becoming an eldritch knight, he must choose which arcane spellcasting class will benefit from all levels of eldritch knight.

<10001><16787217>:Currency
<11001><16788217>:ALFA Core Rules Tip: You can change your PC's description field by using PC Tools Custom Button #4.  Descriptions should include only basic physical appearance and presence, and should not include background information or other meta-data that would be unknown to other PCs.
<11002><16788218>:ALFA Core Rules Tip: Doors which have linked area transitions may now be closed from the right-click contextmenu!  Thank you, NWN2 patch 1.23.
<11003><16788219>:ALFA Core Rules Tip: To rest outdoors, use PC tools to pitch a tent to rest near.  This may only be done outdoors in natural-type areas.  Tents may be taken down using the "remove" object interaction in PC tools.  Rangers and druids may rest outdoors without tents.
<11004><16788220>:ALFA Core Rules Tip: Wizards may scribe tradescrolls to allow other wizards to learn spells they have in their spellbooks.  This is accomplished by casting the spell in question at a spellbook item, and costs 25 gp per spell level (or 12 gp for a 0th level spell).  The resulting tradescroll is not useable to cast the spell from, and cannot be sold, but works for copying into spellbooks. 
<11005><16788221>:ALFA Core Rules Tip: The Campfire from PC tools is a container-type object.  If you need a handy place to dispose of useless items (spare bolts, clothing, 0 gp unsellable items), you may put them into the inventory of the Campfire, then use Object Interaction: Remove (PC Tools) to put the fire out, destroying the objects contained within.
<11006><16788222>:ALFA Core Rules Tip: The subdual feat is granted to every ALFA PC, and allows activation or deactivation of nonlethal combat mode as a free action.  Just drag the feat from the character sheet onto a quickslot on the hotbar to set up for quick and easy toggling of nonlethal damage.
<11007><16788223>:ALFA Core Rules Tip: Text macros may be defined in the PC Tools package, by enabling the Text Macro window.  These allow you to hotkey frequent emotes or lines for use when there isn't as much time for typing, such as while scouting or in combat.  NEW FEATURE: you can now pre-program text emotes to go to the party channel for scouting, in addition to the normal and whisper volumes.
<11008><16788224>:ALFA Core Rules Tip: When you remain logged out for more than one day of game-time, available spells and health will be adjusted accordingly to reflect the passage of time.
<11009><16788225>:ALFA Core Rules Tip: Divine casters may restore their spells once per day using their holy symbol objects, or by using PC Tools Custom button 1 ("Pray for Spells").  Innate casters such as Bards, Sorcerers, Spirit Shamans and Favored Souls restore their spells automatically by resting.  Wizards must use their spellbook items to study for new spells.
<11010><16788226>:ALFA Core Rules Tip: In order to save a dying PC, either apply at least one point of magical healing, or apply first aid using the Heal skill (DC15, repeatable) to bandage the bleeding character.  This may be accomplished by using the quickslottable First Aid widget, or using the right-click contextmenu option labeled "Aid".  There are also masterwork first aid kit items for sale with a limited number of charges, which allow this check to be made with a +2 circumstance bonus.  To receive this benefit, use the MW First Aid kit on the dying PC.
<11011><16788227>:ALFA Core Rules Tip: The corpses of fallen player characters are also portable persistent storage objects.  If you remove the "body" item from the inventory of a PC corpse, the placeable will despawn, and the contents will be saved.  When you drop the "body" item, the corpse will reappear with it's contents intact, even over module resets.  Keep in mind though, that corpses decay over time.
<11012><16788228>:ALFA Core Rules Tip: The "Save Character" option on the main screen of PC Tools, as well as the "Save Location" Custom button, both serve to update your character's persistent location in the database, to ensure that you are able to log back in approximately where you logged out from.  Using this option is especially important if you are going to log out right after returning from a dangerous place within the same area (location saves automatically after ATing).
<11013><16788229>:ALFA Core Rules Tip: Healing potions are targetable items in ALFA, and can be used to save a dying or incapacitated PC.  Be careful when using them in combat, not to activate them while your enemy is actively targetted, or they will be wasted.  In combat, potions will only work on yourself or on a disabled PC (0 or fewer hitpoints).  Outside of combat, they may be used on others (simulates giving someone a potion to drink).
<11014><16788230>:ALFA Core Rules Tip: Spell Scrolls that are above a PC's ability to cast now require Caster Level checks to activate successfully.  If a scroll exceeds a caster's attribute limits (wizard with 14 INT attempting to activate a 5th level Cloudkill spell), it will automatically fail unless the caster posseses ranks in Use Magic Device, in which case an Emulate Attribute check will be rolled first in attempt to circumvent the limitation.  Major failure in a scroll activation check may result in a variety of arcane mishaps.
<11015><16788231>:ALFA Core Rules Tip: The Use Magic Device skill allows a character to attempt to activate spellscrolls intended for any class.  One or two Use Magic Device rolls will be required, depending on the spell and whether the user has high enough attributes to control the spell.  Arcane mishaps are far more likely using this skill than when activating a scroll normally.
<11016><16788232>:ALFA Core Rules Tip: To remove a PC Tools VFX prop from your character (spoon, pan, rake, shovel), left-click on the "VFX Props" heading itself, just above all the options.
<11017><16788233>:ALFA Core Rules Tip: Using the subdual feat or widget (or pressing the PC Tools custom button) activates Subdual mode, for non-lethal combat.  This allows you to subdue other players, or even to incapacitate monsters or hostile NPCs temporarily.  Remember, just because you have subdual mode on, does not mean your opponent does as well.  Subdual works both armed and unarmed, and allows use of modes such as Expertise and Power Attack, but does not work with ranged weapons or magic.  There is also a small risk of doing real damage in a subdual attack. Subdual/nonlethal damage is healed by normal healing spells, and fades with time much more quickly than normal damage.  
<11018><16788234>:ALFA Core Rules Tip: Do not run, unless the situation calls for it urgently.  In many cases the exterior areas of ALFA's servers are meant to represent miles of territory, so it is best to keep time spent running to a minimum.  In order to make your character walk, simply activate tracking mode, search mode, or use shift-left-click to set your destination.  (Search mode will not slow elven PCs to a walking pace, and shift-click on a creature may order an attack, so aim carefully if you use this method.
<11019><16788235>:ALFA Core Rules Tip: Party Chat (/p) should be used for scouting only unless specifically requested by a DM.  This mode of communication excludes nearby PCs who are not in your party, which can cause undue confusion, and passes all text to all DMs logged in, which can make their job difficult.  A Dungeon Master flooded with unwanted text is, generally speaking, not a happy DM.
<11020><16788236>:ALFA Core Rules Tip: Seamless ATs are one of the methods of transitioning between adjacent areas, which allow more freedom in the arrival point.  Upon entering a Seamless AT, you will see a message like "Moving West...".  If you back away from the edge of the area quickly, it will cancel the transition.  You will also be warned if there is danger in the immediate area you are about to move into; and have additional time in which to cancel such a transition.
<11021><16788237>:ALFA Core Rules Tip: Resting may only be done under certain conditions, such as inside an inn room or outdoors near a tent.  Resting will heal damage equal to the character's level and help alleviate attribute damage, as well as prepare them to use magic again.  Praying or Studying for spells may be done anywhere.
<11022><16788238>:ALFA Core Rules Tip:  Adventuring alone is not recommended.  A PC's chances of recovering from an attack that brings him or her into negative hitpoints are exceedingly small without outside assistance.  Most characters that die, die alone.  
<11023><16788239>:ALFA Core Rules Tip: You may italicize normal text by surrounding it in < i > and < /i > tags.
<11024><16788240>:ALFA Core Rules Tip: To check the current time of day onserver, use the "Check Time" button on the main screen of PC Tools.
<11025><16788241>:ALFA Core Rules Tip: To access PC tools for emotes and custom functions, right-click on the ground, and select the "PC Tools" option from the bottom of the list.  You may have to right-click and hold for several seconds, depending on your settings.
<11026><16788242>:ALFA Core Rules Tip: The PC Tools window may be minimized by right-clicking on the box in the upper left-hand corner of the interface.  Left-clicking on the minimized pane restores the screen.  It may also be dragged to the side and out of the way using this icon.
<11027><16788243>:ALFA Core Rules Tip: Disable AI and activate "Puppet Mode" in your settings to keep your PC from making it's own (dubious) combat decisions, like drinking potions and using scrolls you didn't ask it to.  This may need to be done each time you log in, depending.
<11028><16788244>:ALFA Core Rules Tip: To log the text from the game for later review, find your nwn2player.ini file in your /my documents/Neverwinter Nights 2/ folder.  Under [Game Options], add the line "ClientChatLogging=1" and save the change.  This will generate a logfile called "nwclientLog1.txt" containing everything from the chat window.  The logfile is buried in HDD:/Documents and Settings/(username)/Local Settings/Temp/NWN2/LOGS/ where (username) is your Windows username, and Local Settings is a hidden folder.  This file will overwrite each time the game restarts, so remember to rename it before restarting.
<11029><16788245>:ALFA Core Rules Tip: Do not patch Neverwinter Nights 2 until/unless instructed to by Admin.  Whenever a new patch to the game is released, it must be accounted for in the haks and servers before it is formally adopted.  If prompted to patch when connecting to Gamespy, decline and check the forums to see when your server will be patching.  Otherwise, you may be unable to log in until the servers patch, which may be days to weeks later.
<11030><16788246>:ALFA Core Rules Tip: If you see a green sparkle at a door or the edge of an area, it means another PC or NPC is transitioning into your area at that point.  Since it takes some time to load an area in the client, this helps avoid unintentional cross-ATing (missing a PC directly in your path because you were both loading the screen at the same time).  If you do not wish your approach to be noticed by other PCs who may be near the destination of an AT, activate stealth mode before ATing to supress this effect.
<11031><16788247>:ALFA Core Rules Tip: Lutes, Drums, and Flutes are now playable instruments, thanks to BrockFanning's TKL Performer scripts.  Just equip one and start practicing up.  GUI tutorials may be found within the musical instrument interface via the "?" buttons.
<11032><16788248>:ALFA Core Rules Tip: Bastard Swords now require Martial Weapons Proficiency, rather than Exotic. Unless the wielder also has Monkey Grip or Exotic Weapons Proficiency, use of a bastard sword requires two hands.  
<11033><16788249>:ALFA Core Rules Tip: Your character will accumulate XP slowly just for being logged in and roleplaying.  This is tracked by "RP Increments" and "Location Increments".  This XP is awarded after your next login.
<11034><16788250>:ALFA Core Rules Tip: Your character may speak in the various languages he or she knows, by selecting the "VoiceEntry" option on the far right of the DMFI toolbar.  Text entered into the box that opens after you select a language will be translated for others who speak the same language.  Don't be alarmed if the box is labelled "undercommon", you will be speaking the same language you selected.
<11035><16788251>:ALFA Tip: You are 2 characters at a time in ALFA. They must play on different servers.  If you roll up and start playing a third PC, one of your prior character(s) is considered "retired".  You are still allowed to play as many characters as you like on Beta Servers for testing purposes.
<11036><16788252>:ALFA Tip: Sending tells (/t, or player chat window) is a good way to coordinate meetings with other players on the server.  In most cases, you should be able to brainstorm an in-character way for your characters to cross paths if you so choose.  
<11037><16788253>:ALFA Tip: ALFA is a permadeath world.  Once your PC is dead, there is no coming back, unless rare and powerful magic is used.
<11038><16788254>:ALFA Tip: There is no "Save Game" in ALFA.  Make decisions accordingly!
<11039><16788255>:ALFA Tip: Extraordinary PCs (Aasimar, Tieflings, Genasi, and Favored Souls) may be played in ALFA if the character bio is approved.  Contact the Head Dungeon Master (HDM) of your server to find out how.
<11040><16788256>:ALFA Tip: Your character doesn't know how many XP it needs until next level.  Don't rush it!
<11041><16788257>:ALFA Tip: Do not loot your own corpse!
<11042><16788258>:ALFA Tip: Walk, don't run.
<11043><16788259>:ALFA Tip: The light at the end of the tunnel just might be an incoming Fireball spell.
<11044><16788260>:ALFA Tip: Stay on the roads for safety.
<11045><16788261>:ALFA Tip: Torches help you see at night, but they also help you be seen by others.
<11046><16788262>:ALFA Tip: Consider the novelty of a functional childhood for your next PC.  There can only be so many orphaned bastard sons and daughters of fallen noble houses running around.
<11047><16788263>:ALFA Tip: Updates to ALFA's haks and walkmeshes will be downloaded automatically on attempting to connect to a Live server.  If you are planning a trip to a new server for the first time, you can log into the destination server beforehand to get the walkmesh files all downloaded to make the server transition quick and easy.
<11048><16788264>:ALFA Tip: If you are playing a divine caster (cleric, druid, paladin, or ranger), spend some time getting to know the lore and dogma of your character's diety.  Such familiarity may be expected by DMs and other players, and can be great material for roleplay.
<11049><16788265>:ALFA Tip: Druids may not wear metal armor, even if they are multiclassed.  They may, however, use any weapon with which they are proficient.  
<11050><16788266>:ALFA Tip: Paladins and monks have limitations on multiclassing, check the ALFA forums for details.
<11051><16788267>:ALFA Tip: Party up for quests.  Most scripted static quests from NPCs allow a group to accomplish the task together.
<11052><16788268>:ALFA Tip: Once you have come up with a backstory for your character, send it to an active DM as a private message on the forums, so they can post it for the rest of the team.  This helps DMs come up with plots that would be interesting to your character, and get a sense of what he or she is about. Its also possibly worth a little XP!
<11053><16788269>:ALFA Tip: If you have friends who you think might enjoy ALFA, encourage them to apply.  
<11054><16788270>:ALFA Tip: Remember to blink.
<11055><16788271>:ALFA Tip: The quickest route to the grave is going alone.
<11056><16788272>:ALFA Tip: Armor tends not to be very comfortable to wear while eating, drinking, chatting, or sleeping.  Diversify your wardrobe!
<11057><16788273>:ALFA Tip: In polite company, it is considered poor manners to have a weapon equipped.  
<11058><16788274>:ALFA Tip: If you are interested in helping bring ALFA's world to life, consider applying to become a Dungeon Master via the website, www.alandfaraway.info
<11059><16788275>:ALFA Tip: The passage of time is somewhat arbitrary in ALFA.  Try to be ambigious when possible ("some time ago", "recently", "of late", "soon", "in a few days") to avoid confusion.  You can clarify actual times with other players and DMs using private tells.
<11060><16788276>:ALFA Tip: When something is clearly a technical bug, ex: floating trees, water that doesn't line up with the shore, broken walkmesh, or a house part-buried in the terrain, this should be reported via the forums at www.alandfaraway.info - and should not be played as in-character fact.
<11061><16788277>:ALFA Tip: CvC, or Character versus Character combat, is permitted in ALFA when in-character (IC).  However, the DM staff should be informed of premeditated CvC actions, and a DM should ideally be present to adjudicate when possible.
<11062><16788278>:ALFA Core Rules Tip: Dynamic weapon VFX are now available!  Use the custom buttons in PC tools to toggle these on and off, they will bind to the next appropriate item equipped for ease of use.

<color=Red>(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)</color>

Bladesingers are elves who have blended art, swordplay, and arcane magic into a harmonious whole. In battle, a bladesinger's lithe movements and subtle tactics are beautiful, belying their deadly martial efficiency.

Multiclass fighter/wizards are the most obvious candidates for the prestige class, although any elf who can wield a martial weapon and cast arcane spells can become a bladesinger. Bladesinger ranger/wizards, rogue/wizards, and even bards are not unknown.

Bladesingers command great respect in most elf communities and NPC bladesingers usually serve as itinerant guardians and champions of the elf community at large.

<color=Red>(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)</color>

Blurring the line between divine and arcane, mystic theurges draw power from divine sources and musty tomes alike. While most spellcasters choose one path to magical power, mystic theurges walk two roads at once, simultaneously mastering spells common to clerics and wizards. Mystic theurges have unparalleled diversity of spells. In time, a mystic theurge can cast almost any spell in the Player's Handbook. While a mystic theurge doesn't have the uninterrupted spell advancement that a cleric, wizard, or sorcerer has, he makes up for this with versatility. Mystic theurges are often obsessed with magical lore, traveling to the ends of the earth to learn some new arcane secret or divine insight. Because a mystic theurge casts both arcane and divine spells, all members of this class are multiclass spellcasters. Cleric/sorcerers and cleric/wizards are the most common mystic theurges, with druid/sorcerers more rare and druid/wizards almost unheard of. Mystic theurges tend to be fascinated with magic in whatever form it takes. They're always on the hunt for powerful magic items and new arcane spells. Those mystic theurges who worship a deity use the power of their spellcasting to further their deity's agenda

<13039><16790255>:<color=Gold><b>Loremaster</b></color>

<color=Red>(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)</color>

Loremasters are spellcasters who concentrate on knowledge, valuing lore and secrets over gold. They uncover secrets that they then use to better themselves mentally, physically, and spiritually.

Characters without at least one level of wizard, sorcerer, cleric, or druid gain little benefit for becoming a loremaster. Paladins, rangers, and bards might gain some benefit, but overall, it would be minor. Loremasters sometimes gather in secluded cabals but are more often found as members of an order attached to a university, a library, or some other source of information.

They're likely to earn extra money as sages and information brokers, pouring their wages into their own research. A loremaster might also adopt a position as a wise one in a community, or even as its leader, drawing upon her knowledge to help others.
