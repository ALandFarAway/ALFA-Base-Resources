This pack contains three new female hairstyles for humans, aasimar, half-elves, elves and gnomes. 
To use just unpack the contents of the folder and place it into any override.

Note that textures and tintmaps are not the same as original hair, so it may not look nice with 
default color options. Also, the original hair rig was never meant to be used for long hair, 
so the long ponytail feels somewhat rigid.

Hairstyles currently use indices from 50 to 52. I am not aware of any conflicts 
with existing hair, but this may change in the future. This pack does not contain 
any .2da files, so it should not conflict with any non-hair related mods.

Thanks go out to Obsidian (for obvious reasons) and whatbrick, whose package I carefully 
dissected when trying to decide what goes where (no whatbrick's hair were harmed in the process)
